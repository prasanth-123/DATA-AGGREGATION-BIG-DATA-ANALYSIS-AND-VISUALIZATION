INDIAN WELLS Calif Novak Djokovic played first official tennis match month Saturday night defeating American Bjorn Fratangelo straight set BNP Paribas Open
But Djokovic hardly taking extended break official tennis business
Back No 1 world hefty margin also wielding renewed clout court president ATP player council As result maneuvering men tour need new chief executive along collective purpose peace mind likely remain elusive Djokovic ally might like
As ever tension player understandably want maximize earnings brutally competitive sport paymaster operate tournament understandably would rather keep prize money tight rein But unusual inconvenient thing men tennis player paymaster part internally conflicted organization ATP
We really blocked said Gilles Simon French player former council member The structure work u imbalance already tournament player imbalance endures
Acrimony inevitable Progress Last week Djokovic player appeared send strong message player representative ATP Tours board director voted extending contract Chris Kermode ATPs executive chairman president obliged step end 2019
But political power play intimidating player truly united seems far case
The player council nonbinding vote board meeting could reach agreement whether recommend reject Kermodes extension
In age constant communication biggest star somehow struggling connect Roger Federer former president player council said Sunday reached Djokovic vote told Djokovic could squeeze
Thats hard understand Federer said
Rafael Nadal supporter Kermode continuity said cellphone primed ready call text came way
This sound like high school global professional sport
They representing u normally ask whats opinion Not every small decision big decision Nadal said In opinion one big decision
The player tournament three representative ATP board director The chairman Kermode since 2014 ability cast tiebreaking vote would prefer avoid possible fear endangering support one side divide
It difficult dance even best circumstance Kermode seems stepped wrong foot
Djokovic vote That player representative player council supported voted place David Egdes Tennis Channel executive Alex Inglot director communication Sportradar Justin Gimelstob Tennis Channel commentator former American player remains polarizing backroom figure sport remained place despite facing felony battery charge
Under ATPs voting system Kermode needed majority support least two vote camp continue He received three tournament representative vote apparently failed get player representative vote
In letter ATP staff last week ouster Kermode said ironic leaving player achieved greatest gain history ATP Tour past five year
Kermode former lowlevel pro player highlevel tournament director polished genial Briton know work room apparently every boardroom
Running ATP Tour compromised position begin real power tennis lie four Grand Slam tournament function independently Still navigated position weakness five year securing sponsorship hardwon prize money increase top tier ATP tournament
He also led creation new event like Next Gen ATP Finals designed promote young player like 19yearold Canadian Denis Shapovalov eventually step inkblack shadow cast Federer Nadal Djokovic
From I know Chris unbelievable Shapovalov said
But clearly everyone Kermode fan club
He seen player tournament guy characterization reject Others grumble handling ATP Cup relaunched opening week 2020 season Australia
With newlook Davis Cup using similar format Kermode tried avoid teamevent glut working toward combined event But overruled last year player
There also criticism secure prize money gain four Grand Slam event As council president Federer spearheaded successful push major increase Grand Slam revenue growing concern prize money kept pace
Federer Nadal could reenter fray They talked tennis governance coffee Federers rented house last week But 31yearold Djokovics turn lead court He multitasking point career family time ever important verge holding four Grand Slam single title
Why bother tennis politics stage I asked
I tend ask well said grin But I feel responsibility way top player contribute sport way well
Even chart steadier course month come putting player friendly ATP chief place look impossible tournament representative effectively possessing veto power board
Changing governance structure Djokovic suggested sound nearly tricky
Craig Tiley chief executive Tennis Australia driving force Australian Opens growth would strong ATP leader interested chief executive post past
But mutual trust low ebb player union sight likely compromise candidate take
Sure tennis need change fresh idea But tear building seems best clear idea stand place

Kudos Benhabiles helped Andy Roddick become force knowing tennis But kudos Karlovic 6foot11 Croatian finding way fight serve everything life thrown
It hardly problem Karlovic turned 40 Feb 28 definitely still playing
He three round BNP Paribas Open year oldest man win single match Masters 1000 event On Wednesday plenty gray beard well temple Karlovic deploy fearsome weapon Dominic Thiem No 7 seed place quarterfinal
At 25 Thiem 15 year younger Karlovic everybody tour younger Karlovic including former rival coach
Hes older said Ivan Ljubicic 39yearold cocoach Roger Federer remains prominent graybeard men tennis still Karlovics junior 37
Karlovic remained factor overcoming major Achilles tendon injury 2010 encephalitis 2013 caused debilitating headache left temporarily without feeling right arm
He remained force focusing fitness dropping weight take pressure knee joint He 225 pound 245 2011
On court Karlovic learned maximize strength accept weakness He never drive backhand onehanded slice crisp enough And though lateral mobility remains limited compared competitor forehand huge serveandvolley style even unusual disorienting baselinefocused era
In truth style often serveandnovolley He slammed ATP record 13235 ace Along way definitively proven like place movementbased game player towering height like 610 John Isner 33yearold American star 611 Reilly Opelka 21yearold US hitting ace rapid clip
If look sport everywhere taller guy I know future tennis Karlovic said said year
Ljubicic huge serve turn 40 month grew playing junior tournament Karlovic Croatia elsewhere It time war former Yugoslavia tennis often least youngster concern
Fearing life Ljubicics family fled Bosnia ended briefly refugee camp Croatia Ljubicic eventually ended honing game Italian tennis club reaching No 3 world 2006 retiring 2012
Karlovic stayed Zagreb Croatian capital He son welleducated professional father meteorologist mother agronomist
In Zagreb lot airstrikes I spent lot time bomb shelter Karlovic said early teen It always airstrike warning
Funds short quality coaching court time Karlovic already decided preferred tennis basketball despite attempt recruit He would wait evening tennis court Zagreb empty use ball could find hit serf sometimes dark
It way I could practice said I would like people know serve good height I worked lot
He find regular coach early 20 despite imposing presence managed fly far radar first round Wimbledon 2003 allbutunknown qualifier age social medium upset defending champion Lleyton Hewitt four set Centre Court
It easy I looking around huge court I never chance play Karlovic said I lost first set 61 I kind calmed started playing game match easy everybody wanted know I
What made harder pronounced stammer Karlovic since boyhood made public speaking excruciating
I thinking want become good player said postmatch news conference Youre going
Nearly 16 year later stammer much le pronounced Karlovic become excellent player enduring one He peaked ranking No 14 2008 still top 20 last year injury contributed dropping No 138 September
Instead calling career Karlovic chose head back tennis minor league goal making main draw Australian Open If didnt achieve goal would retire He played series ATP Challenger event final month 2018 winning one Calgary
Australia beckoned But Karlovic based Plantation Fla said one biggest challenge leaving family behind He wife Alsi two child 7yearold daughter Jada 18monthold son Noah
I leave Christmas Day get tournament India said So everybody home We friend family lunch I way airport It really difficult My kid cry stuff wasnt easy hand I also know So dont hard I So maybe even pain
He wanted Jada memory professional tennis player
But I also little one oneandahalf year old said Karlovic ranked No 89 So I guess remember Im going play least another eight year
Presumably even Benhabiles ready predict

INDIAN WELLS Calif Deservedly No 1 world age 21 Naomi Osaka made past round 16 first two tournament wearing crown
After stumbling first hurdle Dubai last month two match Indian Wells running Belinda Bencic
Though early start scurrying around hall sounding alarm early observe Osaka midst adjustment process could take time work imagined
In little six month JapaneseAmerican Haitian root become multicultural star global reach fired coach helped zoom No 1 winning two Grand Slam single title row hired new coach yet head coach level
It lot handle lot digest particularly people like poised parse every performance sign trouble
Bencic gave plenty digest beating Osaka game Tuesday taking time initiative away ended Osakas title defense 66 minute round 16 noargument score 63 61
Naomi rushed didnt time dictate said Chris Evert 18time Grand Slam single champion I dont think Naomi come across player like All big hitter like Aryna Sabalenka even Serena close baseline They two three foot back But Bencic play entirely different game played flawless match Shes back back
The proof 11match winning streak includes title Dubai five victory top10 player Born 1997 year Osaka Bencic skill challenge often season come keep head health together Bencic play fifthseeded Karolina Pliskova quarterfinal Thursday
I think time like score line I would usually feel depressed sad Osaka said surprisingly upbeat postmatch news conference But I feel pretty good right I think given circumstance I tried best I dont really regret I tried positive throughout entire match Honestly playing well
It Osakas first look Bencic turned 22 month They first played smallmoney event Alabama clay 2013 Osaka beat Bencic 63 63 came shock considering Bencic already highly regarded junior player Switzerland Osaka barely played junior tennis
But catching Bencic surprise Tuesday She already beaten Osaka straight set 2018 Hopman Cup team event technically exhibition And reaching top 10 2016 dropping back wrist surgery playing pointbypoint focus someone know tennis success trapping given
I know frustrating I wasnt able play Bencic said sounding sage beyond year
Osaka sound bit wiser The meandering sometimes cryptic interview 2018 given way something considered open occasional dash trademark whimsy
This coincidence She watched clip past news conference like saw ums like At new stage greets question many respect giving impression weighing one answering
Asked compare Indian Wells unseeded player 2018 gave another measured response even defeat
I guess one biggest thing I wanted mature said I feel like something Im still working court Its one biggest goal I entire life
I might thrown tantrum last year added And year something Im working improving I feel like going well I think Im confident
Dismissing Sascha Bajin silkenvoiced German coach certainly bold move Under guidance defeated Serena Williams Bajins former employer twice 2018 first round Miami much duress United States Open final With Bajin still side apparently longer confidence Osaka fought another roughandtumble draw win Australian Open January
Neither explained split detail although Osaka said matter money She member team looking lowerprofile coach clearly personal issue work
Something happened must good although thats speculation said Evert often watched Osaka Bajin train Boca Raton Fla They laughing fun practice teasing great Australian Australian tense
Bajin gone replaced Jermaine Jenkins former standout Clemson University spent several year main hitting partner Venus Williams dismissed coach David Witt Jenkins offseason
Jenkins quickly hired national coach United States Tennis Association work national campus Orlando He settling got text message Osakas agent Stuart Duguid inquiring availability
I great new gig USTA I expense report I get text message Jenkins said chuckle week When great adventure offered refuse
Jenkins 34 know full well job security level fragile one big reason drawn USTA post
My wife I live Lake Nona said Plus coaching carousel I didnt want go back another player wake wrong side bed say Hey Im feeling I thinking security I feel like worth
Osaka talent star power certainly short list Jenkins 21 first tournament together included one oncourt coaching visit Osaka jokingly began suggesting midlife crisis
I wanted break ice said
Keeping mood light keeping tennis perspective seem like right idea sort new powerful force work including celebrity megamillions
This also seems good time Osaka remember controlled power controlled emotion displayed win New York Australia anything fluke

katie benner
Theyre discussing extremely strange bizarre extraordinary measure people could imagine ever taking order get kid school
jennifer medina
Theres sort two different way operates The first athletic scheme amasses number coach number different school dozen school agree accept bribe say I want person team All coach get special slot athlete They get admitted university totally different track anybody who athlete
michael barbaro
So coach communicating admission department college Theyre almost getting like personal bucket student athlete
jennifer medina
Absolutely thats exactly way work You get say I want team admission office essentially agrees go along say So he paying coach different college
michael barbaro
And coach pretend someone legitimate athlete theyre And parent play along well
jennifer medina
So elaborate scheme lot case One typical way operating apparently fake photo In one case said I need picture Asian girl playing soccer And going Photoshop applicant face onto photo
michael barbaro
Wow
jennifer medina
Almost every case know person never played team They would drop soon arrived campus In case kid didnt even know expected play team They created profile saying kid ran track get campus speaking college counselor counselor say oh I see run track And kid say talking He didnt even know
michael barbaro
OK thats one scam kind sport coaching method scam What scam FBI discovered
katie benner
He talked arranged student take SAT ACT exam special site bribed proctor test basically correct student answer He talked encouraged parent get child tested disability could time complete exam He talked would sometimes even man adult pose student test center quote unquote controlled adult would take test kid And guy good could basically get score wanted
michael barbaro
Jenny Katie youve described elaborate system wealthy parent bribing childrens way college Arent le risky way rich people get child college
jennifer medina
The world college admission extremely wealthy really complicated So three way get First youve got front door Theres test Theres grade Theres extracurricular activity achievement Theres also issue legacy If parent went college youre trying get youll probably get extra point If play sport might get extra point team Thats front door And there back door
katie benner
There many legal way ultrawealthy gaming system long time get kid school They donate tremendous amount money They help people build building work development project
jennifer medina
And also world incredibly highend tutoring This spending couple hour learning navigate SAT This hundred thousand dollar many time year come sort elaborate way brand essentially something think get right college whatever consider right college So there third door Singer referred side door essentially bribing
katie benner
Cheating
jennifer medina
Cutting middleman cutting pretense anything paying people bribery And I think reason case fascinating sitting talking everybody interested difference two door side door back door Now youre FBI line clear Its clear completely illegal simply bribe somebody get kid college choice But youre one parent youre operating world know many people paying ten thousand dollar hundred thousand dollar university often successful attempt get kid college maybe doesnt seem strange
katie benner
Certainly know breaking law And certainly tell recording transcribed prosecutor parent knew breaking law But also dont act like breaking law completely big deal And seem operate parallel universe different consequence
jennifer medina
They knew crossed line They anyway The anyway actually really interesting really complicated Its though kid went college income potential going grow enormously
michael barbaro
Because theyre already rich
jennifer medina
Theyre already wealthy study shown people go college already coming wealth necessarily see huge jump income lifetime On hand thats true kid come poorer family There lot show especially go highly selective college youre successful there lot thing show income potential go way It path middle class Thats weve always thought college path middle class But clear youre already part mostupper class need go specific college stay upper class
michael barbaro
So Why parent afford participate kind scam If there tangible benefit take risk
jennifer medina
I dont think economics That might part might tell part But obviously least somewhat status maybe able put sticker back car say student go Yale University Maybe want give kid perfect social experience think theyre going right school Or maybe want save kid embarrassment Clearly parent didnt lot faith kid And whats also really fascinating Ivy League school Yale course one sort eyepopping And there Stanford there sort elite school Theres also UCLA But there also school like Wake Forest University University Texas Austin school might fine getting school think holding lot cachet elite circle So Why willing spend much money much effort break law get school We really dont know answer yet
katie benner
Another way look point view parent matter motivation whether social whether want education child believe best education money buy feeling kid face really long odds College never competitive I think Harvard accepted 5 percent student applied last year And understand college also looking wide array student well They dont want class packed people pay full tuition donate million dollar development fund continue give rest life theyre extremely wellheeled Theyre looking something And might worry student extraordinary enough get And theyre going use money try offset systemic inequity like socioeconomic inequity racial inequity offset childrens inability get
jennifer medina
A lot seems certainty security Its question maybe wont get school Its Im going make sure spot specific school want I know I get And I going able breathe sigh relief celebrate congratulate much earlier much confidence I would I gone front door even I gone back door
michael barbaro
And privileged kid actually implicated scheme fit
archived recording
I dont know much school Im going attend Im going go talk dean everyone hope I try balance But I want experience like game day partying I dont really care school
jennifer medina
So kid whose parent participated scheme fascinating It clear knew going many didnt Many probably waking week stunned learn great length parent went cheat behalf great length went hide
katie benner
The parent worked hard keep child knowing going And creates whole layer privilege see education see business see adult parent certainly spade idea know wind back pushing forward helping along believe deserve everything got
jennifer medina
Theyve operating assumption earned spot They deserve And I think forcing u conversation think deserving really mean What done really laid bare u see plain view unequal system truly enough money buy way But time thousand student taking massive loan come desperate get higher education country long believed way get middle upper class Its supposed system based academic merit thats going give path get wherever started want But weve seen thats true If believe education college education specifically great equalizer great equalizer country show system completely broken
katie benner
Its difficult think scenario speaks clearly idea inequity
jennifer medina
What really show there sort way people using money power influence system year completely legal completely accepted And perpetuated every single admission cycle
michael barbaro

He talked arranged student take SAT ACT exam special site bribed proctor test basically correct student answer He talked encouraged parent get child tested disability could time complete exam He talked would sometimes even man adult pose student test center quote unquote controlled adult would take test kid And guy good could basically get score wanted
michael barbaro
Jenny Katie youve described elaborate system wealthy parent bribing childrens way college Arent le risky way rich people get child college
jennifer medina
The world college admission extremely wealthy really complicated So three way get First youve got front door Theres test Theres grade Theres extracurricular activity achievement Theres also issue legacy If parent went college youre trying get youll probably get extra point If play sport might get extra point team Thats front door And there back door
katie benner
There many legal way ultrawealthy gaming system long time get kid school They donate tremendous amount money They help people build building work development project
jennifer medina
And also world incredibly highend tutoring This spending couple hour learning navigate SAT This hundred thousand dollar many time year come sort elaborate way brand essentially something think get right college whatever consider right college So there third door Singer referred side door essentially bribing
katie benner
Cheating
jennifer medina
Cutting middleman cutting pretense anything paying people bribery And I think reason case fascinating sitting talking everybody interested difference two door side door back door Now youre FBI line clear Its clear completely illegal simply bribe somebody get kid college choice But youre one parent youre operating world know many people paying ten thousand dollar hundred thousand dollar university often successful attempt get kid college maybe doesnt seem strange
katie benner
Certainly know breaking law And certainly tell recording transcribed prosecutor parent knew breaking law But also dont act like breaking law completely big deal And seem operate parallel universe different consequence
jennifer medina
They knew crossed line They anyway The anyway actually really interesting really complicated Its though kid went college income potential going grow enormously
michael barbaro
Because theyre already rich
jennifer medina
Theyre already wealthy study shown people go college already coming wealth necessarily see huge jump income lifetime On hand thats true kid come poorer family There lot show especially go highly selective college youre successful there lot thing show income potential go way It path middle class Thats weve always thought college path middle class But clear youre already part mostupper class need go specific college stay upper class
michael barbaro
So Why parent afford participate kind scam If there tangible benefit take risk
jennifer medina
I dont think economics That might part might tell part But obviously least somewhat status maybe able put sticker back car say student go Yale University Maybe want give kid perfect social experience think theyre going right school Or maybe want save kid embarrassment Clearly parent didnt lot faith kid And whats also really fascinating Ivy League school Yale course one sort eyepopping And there Stanford there sort elite school Theres also UCLA But there also school like Wake Forest University University Texas Austin school might fine getting school think holding lot cachet elite circle So Why willing spend much money much effort break law get school We really dont know answer yet
katie benner
Another way look point view parent matter motivation whether social whether want education child believe best education money buy feeling kid face really long odds College never competitive I think Harvard accepted 5 percent student applied last year And understand college also looking wide array student well They dont want class packed people pay full tuition donate million dollar development fund continue give rest life theyre extremely wellheeled Theyre looking something And might worry student extraordinary enough get And theyre going use money try offset systemic inequity like socioeconomic inequity racial inequity offset childrens inability get
jennifer medina
A lot seems certainty security Its question maybe wont get school Its Im going make sure spot specific school want I know I get And I going able breathe sigh relief celebrate congratulate much earlier much confidence I would I gone front door even I gone back door
michael barbaro
And privileged kid actually implicated scheme fit
archived recording
I dont know much school Im going attend Im going go talk dean everyone hope I try balance But I want experience like game day partying I dont really care school
jennifer medina
So kid whose parent participated scheme fascinating It clear knew going many didnt Many probably waking week stunned learn great length parent went cheat behalf great length went hide
katie benner
The parent worked hard keep child knowing going And creates whole layer privilege see education see business see adult parent certainly spade idea know wind back pushing forward helping along believe deserve everything got
jennifer medina
Theyve operating assumption earned spot They deserve And I think forcing u conversation think deserving really mean What done really laid bare u see plain view unequal system truly enough money buy way But time thousand student taking massive loan come desperate get higher education country long believed way get middle upper class Its supposed system based academic merit thats going give path get wherever started want But weve seen thats true If believe education college education specifically great equalizer great equalizer country show system completely broken
katie benner
Its difficult think scenario speaks clearly idea inequity
jennifer medina
What really show there sort way people using money power influence system year completely legal completely accepted And perpetuated every single admission cycle
michael barbaro

Cutting middleman cutting pretense anything paying people bribery And I think reason case fascinating sitting talking everybody interested difference two door side door back door Now youre FBI line clear Its clear completely illegal simply bribe somebody get kid college choice But youre one parent youre operating world know many people paying ten thousand dollar hundred thousand dollar university often successful attempt get kid college maybe doesnt seem strange
katie benner
Certainly know breaking law And certainly tell recording transcribed prosecutor parent knew breaking law But also dont act like breaking law completely big deal And seem operate parallel universe different consequence
jennifer medina
They knew crossed line They anyway The anyway actually really interesting really complicated Its though kid went college income potential going grow enormously
michael barbaro
Because theyre already rich
jennifer medina
Theyre already wealthy study shown people go college already coming wealth necessarily see huge jump income lifetime On hand thats true kid come poorer family There lot show especially go highly selective college youre successful there lot thing show income potential go way It path middle class Thats weve always thought college path middle class But clear youre already part mostupper class need go specific college stay upper class
michael barbaro
So Why parent afford participate kind scam If there tangible benefit take risk
jennifer medina
I dont think economics That might part might tell part But obviously least somewhat status maybe able put sticker back car say student go Yale University Maybe want give kid perfect social experience think theyre going right school Or maybe want save kid embarrassment Clearly parent didnt lot faith kid And whats also really fascinating Ivy League school Yale course one sort eyepopping And there Stanford there sort elite school Theres also UCLA But there also school like Wake Forest University University Texas Austin school might fine getting school think holding lot cachet elite circle So Why willing spend much money much effort break law get school We really dont know answer yet
katie benner
Another way look point view parent matter motivation whether social whether want education child believe best education money buy feeling kid face really long odds College never competitive I think Harvard accepted 5 percent student applied last year And understand college also looking wide array student well They dont want class packed people pay full tuition donate million dollar development fund continue give rest life theyre extremely wellheeled Theyre looking something And might worry student extraordinary enough get And theyre going use money try offset systemic inequity like socioeconomic inequity racial inequity offset childrens inability get
jennifer medina
A lot seems certainty security Its question maybe wont get school Its Im going make sure spot specific school want I know I get And I going able breathe sigh relief celebrate congratulate much earlier much confidence I would I gone front door even I gone back door
michael barbaro
And privileged kid actually implicated scheme fit
archived recording
I dont know much school Im going attend Im going go talk dean everyone hope I try balance But I want experience like game day partying I dont really care school
jennifer medina
So kid whose parent participated scheme fascinating It clear knew going many didnt Many probably waking week stunned learn great length parent went cheat behalf great length went hide
katie benner
The parent worked hard keep child knowing going And creates whole layer privilege see education see business see adult parent certainly spade idea know wind back pushing forward helping along believe deserve everything got
jennifer medina
Theyve operating assumption earned spot They deserve And I think forcing u conversation think deserving really mean What done really laid bare u see plain view unequal system truly enough money buy way But time thousand student taking massive loan come desperate get higher education country long believed way get middle upper class Its supposed system based academic merit thats going give path get wherever started want But weve seen thats true If believe education college education specifically great equalizer great equalizer country show system completely broken
katie benner
Its difficult think scenario speaks clearly idea inequity
jennifer medina
What really show there sort way people using money power influence system year completely legal completely accepted And perpetuated every single admission cycle
michael barbaro
Jenny Medina Katie Benner thank much

Keira Braithwaite Hoggard High
Allowing increased representation historically disadvantaged group vital priority Hollywood monumental cultural moment Though may sound surprising entertainment industry history discrimination institutional issue explains Marvels decadelong wait release superhero film dont focus white male character
A year ago Black Panther permanently impacted popular culture groundbreaking image African heroism massive boxoffice success Similarly Captain Marvel symbolize longawaited moment superhero representation time woman rather AfricanAmericans If film becomes another groundbreaking success could shatter fallacy woman watch movie men men watch movie woman Black Panther connected million moviegoer felt seen like never others white still loved film
Greater diversity crucial area medium Marvel crucially different The studio created biggest blockbuster last ten year Each release seismic mustsee event Marvel position creating image empower influence current generation viewer follow footstep favorite character Many people argue viewer focus gender race fantasy character In 2019 though representation still essential

Mariska Masterman school Philly
As thing course woman need representation superhero field I asked 5 people house including favorite superhero The answer I got I expected four people said favorite superhero man Well person named female superhero youre probably wondering That person 6 year old cousin boy Even I gave context intention still said Wonder Woman favorite superhero
Then I started thinking young child exposed male female superheroes maybe could make decision It child fault exposed gender superheroes producer There dozen superhero movie male lead barely female lead superhero movie I think superheroes mostly considered boy activity think woman superhero eliminate prime audience However Wonder Woman made approximately 821 million dollar box office There excuse anymore I think Marvel DC continue make female lead production success proven

But female superheroes
In previous Marvel movie woman treated like accessory way move plot along purpose man Black Widow another female superhero never stand alone film even though shes franchise almost long Iron Man In previous movie Marvel woman often love interest oversexualized I think success Captain Marvel show Marvel big company people watch female superheroes without sexualized love interest Captain Marvel favorite superhero let alone female superhero reason behind I look I see woman I look life simply
Angela Froming School Woods Houston TX
By oversaturating super hero industry lack luster lazy forgettable woman hero Marvel movie studio making woman super hero look bad I believe woman hero great addition super hero universe And I believe never seen successful super hero movie star woman majority film overwhelmingly bad
So fix I propose give effort It much needed female leadership country mostly male position But need dignity thought go movie The hero well developed interesting character The story surround le corny cliche And time take write movie longer order ensure maximum thought effort poured creating impactful influential woman hero
Ezra Lombardi
I dont feel gender superhero matter What I think really matter power hero hero role Marvel general lot powerful character female For example Avengers Infinity War Black Widow Scarlet Witch Okoye take Proxima Midnight All character fight seen woman extraordinary role Black Widow assassin Scarlet Witch pretty much warp reality Okoye courageous warrior called one best ever Wakanda lastly Proxima Midnight superhuman ability like enhanced strength agility Even though dont currently movie play humongous role MCU I think Captain Marvel Movie push female superhero role movement edge I think movie revolved around female superhero great I look forward seeing near future
Kenneth R Masterman School Philadelphia
I believe Captain Marvel great representation superhero movie movie female superhero interesting story That important throughout history child look superheroes little girl superhero positive role model thats like By movie female lead inspire girl show female leadership look like

Ami S Masterman Philadelphia
Marvel business entertainment politics
I dont understand people take movie blast proportion way bigger Comic book movie made entertainment doesnt matter kind character get movie whether black Hispanic female even Norse god People often see movie like Wonder Woman say really big leap woman reality DC making movie one popular character movie said nothing sexism didnt even kind undertone I think thats made movie good People dont go movie politics go movie entertained shouldnt matter whether movie female lead thing matter entertaining
Wyatt Young Hoggard High School
While ideal strive I believe Marvel hold moral responsibility towards compensatory representation woman pursuit equal gender representation The entire purpose film generally artistic medium create meaningful experience invoke emotion regurgitate political climate current time
As said within article leak 2014 email Isaac Perlmutter chairman Marvel Entertainment disparaged female superhero film like Supergirl 1984 Catwoman 2004 Elektra 2005 poor boxoffice performance Itzkoff Mr Perlmutters remark might seemed distasteful fact matter simply job As CEO Marvel company looking best interest corporation
Andrei Mistreanu Hoggard High School Wilmington NC
These business activist group What Avengers without Captain America What Justice League without Superman A superhero isnt determined gender The time different majority beloved superhumans created Captain America created 40 Captain Marvel first introduced main protagonist 1967 Marvel DC shouldnt pressured star female female To quote Megamind hero arent made theyre born When superhero chosen movie proved merit interesting story exist one gender We NEED female superheroes We NEED Marvel DC We NEED let independent company choose right person wow u big screen
Brian Marks John T Hoggard Wilmington NC
I never got gender superhero mattered Why So people make big deal gender Whenever I watch Marvel movie I never think Hey thats female superhero There need woman I believe female representation going wrong One problem hype around movie shes woman Marvel likely money They hold back female representation finally release movie focused woman people go nut turn support character woman Instead focusing everything female character focus movie good It much female representation superhero movie make good movie

The ultimate superhero
When I think ultimate superhero I think mother Superheros known honorable quality They selfless people mother Most woman give They give birth become mother raise family etc They fact spend much time taking care others find time taking care Although mother might stop oncoming villain protect raise future different
My mother always matter moody I get I remember talking back constantly cleaning room despite hateful attitude never gave always showed grace She pushed clean room take care thing later benefited many way She pushed reach villain costume find inner hero
Without mother wouldnt future They raise produce next generation They make save life everywhere without cape They real hero

Most player chance making stardom slim many challenging break even financially paying travel training expense That ITF commissioning extensive study declared old structure unsustainable Too many marginal player basically masquerading professional
The ITFs mission promote tennis around world organization work ensure tournament continent But event open comer included player little hope breaking top tier 50 year old The ITF study determined one year many 6000 socalled professional player earn even 1 A recent independent investigation also found tsunami fixed match lower level player earning little prize money vulnerable betting syndicate

katie benner
And Singer begin help FBI
jennifer medina
He agrees wear wire He agrees go back client he worked year tape excruciating detail he done He agrees call people he worked people he accepted bribe people he given bribe Some parent Some coach Some associate people he paying one way another
katie benner
Theyre discussing extremely strange bizarre extraordinary measure people could imagine ever taking order get kid school
jennifer medina
Theres sort two different way operates The first athletic scheme amasses number coach number different school dozen school agree accept bribe say I want person team All coach get special slot athlete They get admitted university totally different track anybody who athlete
michael barbaro
So coach communicating admission department college Theyre almost getting like personal bucket student athlete
jennifer medina
Absolutely thats exactly way work You get say I want team admission office essentially agrees go along say So he paying coach different college
michael barbaro
And coach pretend someone legitimate athlete theyre And parent play along well
jennifer medina
So elaborate scheme lot case One typical way operating apparently fake photo In one case said I need picture Asian girl playing soccer And going Photoshop applicant face onto photo
michael barbaro
Wow
jennifer medina
Almost every case know person never played team They would drop soon arrived campus In case kid didnt even know expected play team They created profile saying kid ran track get campus speaking college counselor counselor say oh I see run track And kid say talking He didnt even know
michael barbaro
OK thats one scam kind sport coaching method scam What scam FBI discovered
katie benner
He talked arranged student take SAT ACT exam special site bribed proctor test basically correct student answer He talked encouraged parent get child tested disability could time complete exam He talked would sometimes even man adult pose student test center quote unquote controlled adult would take test kid And guy good could basically get score wanted
michael barbaro
Jenny Katie youve described elaborate system wealthy parent bribing childrens way college Arent le risky way rich people get child college
jennifer medina
The world college admission extremely wealthy really complicated So three way get First youve got front door Theres test Theres grade Theres extracurricular activity achievement Theres also issue legacy If parent went college youre trying get youll probably get extra point If play sport might get extra point team Thats front door And there back door
katie benner
There many legal way ultrawealthy gaming system long time get kid school They donate tremendous amount money They help people build building work development project
jennifer medina
And also world incredibly highend tutoring This spending couple hour learning navigate SAT This hundred thousand dollar many time year come sort elaborate way brand essentially something think get right college whatever consider right college So there third door Singer referred side door essentially bribing
katie benner
Cheating
jennifer medina
Cutting middleman cutting pretense anything paying people bribery And I think reason case fascinating sitting talking everybody interested difference two door side door back door Now youre FBI line clear Its clear completely illegal simply bribe somebody get kid college choice But youre one parent youre operating world know many people paying ten thousand dollar hundred thousand dollar university often successful attempt get kid college maybe doesnt seem strange
katie benner
Certainly know breaking law And certainly tell recording transcribed prosecutor parent knew breaking law But also dont act like breaking law completely big deal And seem operate parallel universe different consequence
jennifer medina
They knew crossed line They anyway The anyway actually really interesting really complicated Its though kid went college income potential going grow enormously
michael barbaro
Because theyre already rich
jennifer medina
Theyre already wealthy study shown people go college already coming wealth necessarily see huge jump income lifetime On hand thats true kid come poorer family There lot show especially go highly selective college youre successful there lot thing show income potential go way It path middle class Thats weve always thought college path middle class But clear youre already part mostupper class need go specific college stay upper class
michael barbaro
So Why parent afford participate kind scam If there tangible benefit take risk
jennifer medina
I dont think economics That might part might tell part But obviously least somewhat status maybe able put sticker back car say student go Yale University Maybe want give kid perfect social experience think theyre going right school Or maybe want save kid embarrassment Clearly parent didnt lot faith kid And whats also really fascinating Ivy League school Yale course one sort eyepopping And there Stanford there sort elite school Theres also UCLA But there also school like Wake Forest University University Texas Austin school might fine getting school think holding lot cachet elite circle So Why willing spend much money much effort break law get school We really dont know answer yet
katie benner
Another way look point view parent matter motivation whether social whether want education child believe best education money buy feeling kid face really long odds College never competitive I think Harvard accepted 5 percent student applied last year And understand college also looking wide array student well They dont want class packed people pay full tuition donate million dollar development fund continue give rest life theyre extremely wellheeled Theyre looking something And might worry student extraordinary enough get And theyre going use money try offset systemic inequity like socioeconomic inequity racial inequity offset childrens inability get
jennifer medina
A lot seems certainty security Its question maybe wont get school Its Im going make sure spot specific school want I know I get And I going able breathe sigh relief celebrate congratulate much earlier much confidence I would I gone front door even I gone back door
michael barbaro
And privileged kid actually implicated scheme fit
archived recording
I dont know much school Im going attend Im going go talk dean everyone hope I try balance But I want experience like game day partying I dont really care school
jennifer medina
So kid whose parent participated scheme fascinating It clear knew going many didnt Many probably waking week stunned learn great length parent went cheat behalf great length went hide
katie benner
The parent worked hard keep child knowing going And creates whole layer privilege see education see business see adult parent certainly spade idea know wind back pushing forward helping along believe deserve everything got
jennifer medina
Theyve operating assumption earned spot They deserve And I think forcing u conversation think deserving really mean What done really laid bare u see plain view unequal system truly enough money buy way But time thousand student taking massive loan come desperate get higher education country long believed way get middle upper class Its supposed system based academic merit thats going give path get wherever started want But weve seen thats true If believe education college education specifically great equalizer great equalizer country show system completely broken
katie benner
Its difficult think scenario speaks clearly idea inequity
jennifer medina
What really show there sort way people using money power influence system year completely legal completely accepted And perpetuated every single admission cycle
michael barbaro
Jenny Medina Katie Benner thank much

The previous arrangement said Philip Ballinger associate vice provost overseeing admission didnt sufficient transparency didnt enough eye
The leeway coach get recruiting long point discussion higher education circle But federal investigator last week revealed broad admission cheating scandal number college began asking hard question evaluate athletic applicant oversee chosen coach recommend admission
In prosecutor described biggest case admission fraud investigated 50 people accused scheme involved paying bribe coach people monitor admission test order fraudulently get child wealthy patron nation elite college
Some student accepted recruited athlete even though play sport described application They gained advantage widespread practice allocating certain number admission spot athlete might get otherwise
This process followed decade pursuit competitive team burnish university reputation inspire alumnus loyalty often help fundraising
Now fraud case sent thunderbolt higher education community
Every college president America called athletic director morning admission fraud story broke asked How make sure doesnt happen school said Bill Martin athletic director University Michigan 2000 retirement 2010 And certain athletic director smart enough call president first insist going start verifying status every admitted recruited athlete
Indeed Yale University FBI investigator say longtime woman soccer coach accepted hundred thousand dollar facilitate admission recruit actually play soccer university president Peter Salovey announced late last week new oversight policy already put place The Yale athletic director begin reviewing every proposed recruit credential admission recruited athlete fail make team arrive receive close scrutiny university statement said
A broad overhaul athletic admission system Division I highest level NCAA competition level college scheme compete overdue according several athletic administrator interviewed recent day
Battles bluechip recruit football basketball already tend heavily scrutinized In upper echelon sport money changing hand coach recruit way around
But lowerprofile sport like crew volleyball tennis soccer often called Olympic sport room bribe exploitation And common route fraud designate phony athletic prospect recruited walkon In nearly every case counterfeit athletic credential cited last week indictment Stanford Texas Yale prospective athlete appeared filling nebulous role recruited walkon
Such applicant even assured spot team But often list five 20 athlete varies sport sport coach permitted submit admission department
The two daughter actress Lori Loughlin charged connection fraud case last week passed crew recruit despite never competed sport according federal prosecutor
That choice sport may accident In sport like woman crew roster balloon 125 athlete many team score recruited walkons Such large roster help college comply federal equality law balancing number male athlete football
When roster big like woman crew I could see would possible coach slip unqualified person recruited walkon said Martin added Michigan annually audited team roster
The recruitment athlete sport may even bigger factor admission process college NCAAs lowest tier Division III athletic scholarship forbidden
Division III also largest tier nearly 450 institution including many country selective small liberal art college acceptance rate low 15 percent These college might field many 30 team enrollment small 2000 varsity athlete many afforded advantage admission making 30 percent 45 percent student body
These small college like largest one also give preferential treatment applicant excel music art host skill There also allowance student leastpopulated state
Admissions filling different bucket said Wendy Smith athletic director Haverford College highly rated institution near Philadelphia And athlete right We way gaming system They absolutely par academically
The cost fielding successful sport team ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often lead troubling conflict interest
In Ivy League example coach responsible fundraising bridge gap support college true price tag competing successfully That lead uncomfortable decision composing team especially since athlete family often become leading donor
You family give 25000 going play daughter said Paul Wardlaw woman tennis coach Brown University 14 year
The whole scandal interesting human nature take easy route said systematic issue contributing
At many elite institution notion recruited athlete granted unfair advantage palpable
Cameron Green tight end football team Northwestern University accepts 13 percent applicant conceded several high school classmate play sport applied Northwestern rejected
Its easier athlete get I know thats hard regular student said Green senior plan play football final year eligibility A lot kid I knew confused I got didnt know end day school look demographic piece paper decides admit even meet
The high percentage recruited athlete college particularly smaller one consequence odds institutional ambition diverse student body
Because success youth sport today often come easily affluent family spend copiously private instruction roster college team become predominantly white nearly 80 percent small school
In end higher education community believe last week admission fraud scandal embarrassing lesson policy change need made nevertheless creating false impression state admission procedure American college
There notion admission competitive cesspool said Michael Reilly executive director American Association College Registrars Admissions Officers In fact Reilly added campus nationwide fail meet enrollment goal But segment thats highly competitive created completely different dynamic If I campus Id sitting saying Lets rethink

Has social medium changed way public perceives work Yes here example 20 year ago saw something TV offended wanted let someone know wouldve get pen paper write Dear BBC Im bothered But didnt much trouble Now Twitter go Expletive comedian who offended Then journalist see say Soandso said thing people furious No The rest u dont give expletive wouldnt heard hadnt made headline Everything exaggerated But everythings also illusion No one would talk street like Twitter Theyd never come say Your article stink Theyd never theyre normal theyre normal Twitter there nuance irony conversation
So take seriously You dont If ignore Twitter didnt happen Its like going toilet stall arguing graffiti If dont go doesnt exist
But go I For fun Or sometimes research If Im warmup show Im five minute short material Ill search Twitter provocative thing You find dark corner Thats good thing Twitter I used meet maniac like Agent Clarice Starling meeting Hannibal Lecter Now I find dreg safety Hampstead mansion
Has Twitter good comedy It I see cross section society thousand time faster I couldve otherwise Ive got 13 million follower Thats world really Ill tweet Whats subject never joke Some people fall trap say something like Psoriasis Then I come 10 minute
Sounds like good 10 minute Whats something youve researched online helpful developing joke way Theres load thing Onstage Ill read response These thing never joke whatever I say quite funny head think one person angry joke People think someone joking issue worst thing world I joke Fallon peanut allergy someone said I never talk food allergy I joke AIDS famine cancer Holocaust youre telling I shouldnt joke allergy The audience got clever enough know Im playing idiot saying wrong thing comic effect Thats one thing comedy laughing wrong thing know right thing
What make confident audience know All give clue I tweet said something like Im typical liberal lefty socialist snowflake I agree antiracists yet I talk freedom speech Im suddenly altright1 When happen
Youre saying Twitter dirty toilet stall human thought also rely generate material Arent interesting place look Do mean I fighting easiest target Why I picking extreme example Because Im comedian politician My job funny If I little intelligence fall right side thats bonus To answer question Do I care there someone who taking irony face value You cant legislate stupidity These fair question youre asking unfair ask comedian The misunderstanding contentious subject comedian deal people think he taking wrong side Ive heard posh radio show discussing whether Ricky Gervais dealing comedy Well youre talking Why cant I deal comedy You might like I say doesnt mean I shouldnt deal
To mind bigger question isnt whether somebody shouldnt joke subject course everything fair game No course Everyone say there one thing make go Too soon Wrong forum When I write joke like Ive gone Thats funny I dont care hate I try make anyones offended I explain shouldnt
What I saying rational person listening good faith probably belief subject table joke Thats right rare
So important question whether joke aimed worthwhile target theyre cheap I understand point fair question The joke I Humanity special When youre raped Satan Ill laughing thats irresistible mental If le mental wouldnt funny If someone say I dont agree atheism OK I cant go anywhere joke So I pick extreme example theyre funnier
The material Humanity provoked And I knew would special went Caitlyn Jenner
My question Caitlyn Jennerspecific joke You build bit larger thing transgender identification get part wanting selfidentify chimp named Bobo Is instance material intellectually achieving wanted achieve That bit change halfway So I come Im explaining joke Golden Globes I stand It celebrity killing someone car2 That clearly joke But I say people thought I feud Caitlyn Jenner I go It clickbait Of course I rose bait So Im saying Im spoiled childish Then I get spoiled childish bit go I become idiot belief transgender changing chimp But I joke like I mean work
To connect something said earlier Was audience laughing right thing You dont think lot people laughing comparison transgender person someone want identify chimp Some people logical get Some also people saying I might agree he gone far Im glad he scared talk Im talking subject new material Im talking case people arent trans theyre saying get put woman prison rape woman
That isnt really thing Oh yeah actual thing3 I say genuine trans people arm Im clear perpetrator Im talking arent trans people Then I play get thing wrong within joke
Why transgender people seem like ripe subject matter Is youre level uncomfortable Its Twitter You look Twitter seems like trans activist versus TERFs4 going end like battle scene Game Thrones Then go real world happening
You might want spend le time social medium Im fine long I properly calibrate whats online also still remember walk outside sun
That sound like drug addict saying Im fine long I balance upper downer I could wrong But I know Im There idiot Twitter But idiot High Street They dont talk
I imagine possible critic arent willing give credit way move standup telling joke intended understood dumb telling joke intended understood smart Is elision part bother people Well exactly Ill smarta play religious belief5 whatever go way Most people havent got time analyze joke I go parody fast But long I know target people get agree I think joke justified
This realm therapist question often play character whether David Brent The Office Tony After Life compulsively commit social faux pa How much Do feel always level selfawareness youre saying I try I ironic joke social life All people joke dont explain Whereas feel need explain joke stranger Deep I want 10000 stranger come see perform know Im nice guy
Whyd get standup Youre one comedian 20 No I wasnt God I would awful I didnt know anything I cant think I would talked Before I could I learn relate Getting fat old ugly helped I dont know youve heard Simon Amstell Hes British comedian He said something young handsome people comedy like People already looking need
Do need I dont I enjoy I didnt enjoy much Humanity I think I proud rather I approached differently With Humanity I didnt write like I special Instead I walked beer started talking stuff like I Twitter It felt brilliant The audience engaged straightaway The good thing special audience known 15 year So I could throw selfreferential thing get low status anymore Traditionally British comedy comedian wallowing mud people But people know comedian earn I cant go talk Well Im welfare So I get low status two way I talk money irony When I flew private plane first time thought I cook And way I talk thing audience better I talk fat old descended testicle
Is idea outsider important Its really important But I dont one people paid see They know Im one got lucky But I outsider host Golden Globes Thats I bite hand feed Imagine I went nice George Clooney People home would going Who expletive
How reconcile need outsider fact youre clearly one anymore I still outsider reminding people Establishment hate
They cant hate much You make TV show You play arena I privileged position I remind audience everyone like And sort true Im son immigrant laborer I wear bad jean drink expletive lager Its part illusion Audiences need side You cant go hate audience want hate Theres enough people would pay know Its still business Im ashamed making money
Whats best thing youve bought money Tennis court
Are good Oh But lovely
Is criticism youve gotten felt helpful Or even valid I felt bad Tim Allen Golden Globes gag He Tom Hanks handing award I said Ill go next two presenter The first made 35 billion box office Oscar blah blah blah The second Tim Allen Thats unfair But unfair anyone standing next Tom Hanks going get treatment
Also care Its roast joke Tim Allen But I dont want Tim Allen think I mean Hes great career As long people go Thats bit harsh rather Yes Tim Allen expletive useless Id hate Its one standing next Tom Hanks know I worry thing Because person end joke
Hollywood award show held day real social importance way werent even year back What make shift Ive got nothing someone using platform political idea Despite people think Im judgmental One minute I go Hollywood taking seriously I go Trump caring Hollywood And I walk two side I keep politics show
Why Because youre relying audience agreeing youre rallying It loses something comedically Comedy intellectual pursuit emotional one Thats I dont real racist sexist homophobic joke
I would hope youre racist sexist homophobe Of course But I lot joke arent I dont remember thing real life Its like start joke Why Mexicans Ill stop whatever answer dont Racist joke dont work comedically But joke race
Im surprised dont think comedy emotional Laughing But triggered getting joke If dont agree joke premise youre going laughing If Hitler telling best joke world wouldnt laugh Wed going What bad expletive he done
A minute ago said comedy loses something audience agreeing I think youre crazy Oh go
If believe vast majority people buy ticket Ricky Gervais show dont agree believe take sensitive subject I play cosmopolitan area theyre smart enough get irony That come back question I pick extreme example Because theyre easier people get Particularly youre something contentious dont want start misunderstanding There rule talking canceled wokeness clearer pick someone like John Wayne Canceled 40 year death woke 48yearold issue Playboy magazine6 His quote awful But As example I joke taking Confederate statue I said They amendment Great general A bit racist
On subject cancelthem culture think work someone like Louis CK Or Kevin Hart Kevin Hart apologized homophobic joke If people dont accept person apology mistake there value person trying improve And I hate virtuesignaling Ill tell bad Because pathetic people accusation people saying theyre like accused Theyre saying Look good I Theyre saying I hate thing I would never Why telling u
Presumably offended If I wanted get back Well done Rick Keep good work boy I might well tweet I rapist Please dont use headline
You said Im cold sweat
But get back question How know behavior someone like Louis CK affect thinking comedy done It depends deed accusation time much liked You make mind The Louis CK thing allowed gig Yeah Are people allowed protest Yeah But cant change history When leaked thing came I listened People saying God terrible Hes gone altright And contentious stuff loved two year ago
I disagree The problem new material good Thats opinion
Theyre hackier joke But point nothing quality material Its Louis CK isnt suddenly altright People look he changed whole outlook life way writes joke
Let ask question related After Life Yes best Im already sweating thing Ive said
The show man who decided result grief dispense social nicety As famous person successful person different perspective rest u value lack value obligatory social behavior u might ditch little power The reason nice people consequence nice would make life worse Why I lie every day Because I dont want hurt people feeling Can come christening I cant Im giving blood orphanage I dont say Why would I want come christening baby Its boring
Your last show Derek irony bitterness After Life element also get sweetness Derek Do see show conversation I dont I treat show like exploration theme Derek PhD kindness After Life PhD social nicety grief The Office PhD mundanity thrown together 9to5 Extras PhD ambition fame
Im curious meant first project created The Office highly regarded Everyone agrees great TV No dont Some people hate comforting It reminds everyone different opinion subjective doesnt matter
Peoples incorrect negative opinion The Office aside early acclaim shape selfconfidence selfdoubt You ignore You know there going backlash With every six month For last 15 20 year least year there article saying end Ricky Gervaiss career The first time I thought Really Is The second time I thought Is Third time I went Here go Fourth time I went No And polarize youre anything mildly artistic
I guess someone somewhere didnt like Beatles I didnt
Now thats offensive I preferred Stones I appreciate Beatles
How view trajectory work Does The Office stand apart No Im always going affection show It first time Id tried hardest anything Im one kid went I didnt study exam still got A minus
Do sense youd The Office fizzled Working chapeau shop Maybe haberdashery If want quote Spinal Tap line well day My favorite much expletive perspective Me Jane7 said line every day 10 year I sent Chris Guest8 six episode After Life He sent back beautiful email weeping
This reminds interview recalled conversation youd Christopher Guest You two talked I think Englishism used going boil Yeah saying What funny anymore dont know I went Who care
Do think creative person accurately judge there decline work Probably It depends aim If keep getting popular youre probably going fail If keep getting paid could work Its worked I get asked Whats pipe dream Id like live middle wood In mansion Surrounded rescue dogs9 With mod con hermetically seal mansion spider cant get Thats answer
So youre one tortured artist constantly thinking successful I remember I young hair I saw Michael Caine10 said hed done Jaws movie buy new house I thought Idiot You let Now I think Good house real thing Rotten Tomatoes11 isnt real thing So within reason I want I want every day proud work nice life

The Venn overlap great anyone thought said Scott Galloway professor marketing New York University Stern School Business founder digital think tank L2 Technology essentially creating utility spreading billion people Fashion creating moment trend romance spreading across small amount influential people
This mean wearable although would good someone could think different word category since theoretically could apply anything put body
By account smartwatch industry account 44 percent wearable device market according research group International Data Corporation fine IDC predicts watch among main driver 153 percent growth market year A new report NPD group said 2018 sale smartwatches United States increased 54 percent
In Apples Q1 2019 earnings call January Mr Cook said wearable category 50 percent primarily mean watch AirPods A spokesman Hermès said Apple watch one popular model Louis Vuittons smartwatch account half watch business
But upon time rumor designer joining gang third party like Coach Kate Spade made band Apple watch talk day watch platform health fitness also fitness brand Nike especially still gungho
That mean fashion interested technology There lot excitement among executive I speak augmented reality shopping tool As far material science production technology hugely promising especially industry look sustainability

We put creative energy fashion design jacket digital collateral rather physical collateral Mr Dillinger said
Mr Galloway NYU said conclusion simple There one wearable really fashion statement phone Which may root problem We thought wherever led everything else would follow Apparently
All suggests fashiontech PDAs Were kind platonic acquaintance Every nice meet air kiss
So learned last five year
Maybe real future fashion technology nothing screen
Maybe concept hero product associated world technology doesnt really work context industry already hero product Hollywood might take note one Indeed Mr Dillinger said initially quite skeptical idea Jacquard I really value object fashion said
Its possible dont actually want clothes accessory much already make u feel good tool selfexpression symbol membership group clue aspiration
Thats phone And though one necessarily saw coming AirPods Vuitton earphone cost almost 1000 since introduction January sold three time secondgeneration LV smartwatch released time currently wait list acting visible semaphore identity

I always tried bring much variety onto court possible Barty said Its always trying neutralize opponent Obviously bit phase woman tennis big power first striker getting top rally early But I think physicality tennis especially woman side grown allowed player neutralize big first ball work way point
She proved point repeatedly Saturday displaying improved return tracking Pliskovas flat bolt corner slicing back play But ample punching power quite upside It easy see thriving clay see French Open grass see Wimbledon
It also easy imagine breakthrough could come earlier decided step away tennis 2014 United States Open focus cricket instead But view break ended 2016 allowed better manage expectation begin fulfilling tennis potential

My motherinlaw recently regaled tale intrigue money power South Florida homeowner association
Seeking raise 6 million refurbish 20yearold community association board voted ass homeowner 7000 But group vocal resident fought back setting power struggle
This conflict nothing new anyone dealt condominium board homeowner association welldefined obligation resident As overseer hire worker cut lawn take trash clean lobby common area maintain pool tennis court golf course amenity If elevator break roof leak board get fixed
But want something cosmetic renovate lobby add pickle ball court install fitness center board need put idea vote resident
And good reason These expense add quickly Redoing lobby cost owner 30000 In luxury development typically fewer owner special assessment big project top 100000 per home And thats top common fee outpace even wealthy person retirement income
The internet full website devoted ridiculous story condo board fight The tale humorous except think would like face fine tree short leaving pumpkin porch day Halloween wearing camouflage attire youre soldier reporting duty
Florida long history condo craziness amplified Del Boca Vista episode Seinfeld state condo immune Arizona thousand homeowner association unchecked power New York famous battle exclude evict otherwise bos around people buy milliondollar apartment Even Texas homeowner association credited bringing order city lack proper zoning law share dustup
But story obscure lure living association someone else take care laborious job homeowner In exchange might always get way
If dont want live rule buy singlefamily house whatever want said Werner Schroeder sale associate Sothebys International Realty
But people buy one development home cost million dollar landing middle board dispute financial disaster A renovation costly lengthy keeping property fresh hurt real estate value development newer amenity spring Throw legal battle cost rise quickly
Most battle happen condo power grab said Rebecca S Trinkler lawyer Buchanan Ingersoll Rooney There dispute board member seen taking advantage position
For example said knew condo board president used association fund buy pool table club chair pal could hang And board member gave contract condo renovation family member
In Miami Beach Fla condo called Nine Island Avenue became case study remodel pool area One resident daughter developer sued condo president renovation done building including changing color koi pond removing old trellis selecting new pool furniture The case went arbitration judge sided resident saying change never approved resident undone
Most battle settled arbitration legal cost still run ten thousand dollar

Scott Diffenderfer broker real estate agency Compass bought condo Nine Island Avenue clash figured dispute would eventually resolved But took several year said
Florida Wild West stuff said There many condo youd think theyd figure havent
That building unit cost 24 million undergoing lobby renovation expected cost 8 million Mr Diffenderfers assessment 37000 said
When board resident clash temper flare resident take side big legal bill often follow Yet determining fault never easy One person selfless board volunteer another person condo commando But root many dispute issue transparency misunderstanding overreach course money
Ms ManningHudson said good rule thumb board member put big decision vote But also need know deferring required maintenance make board member personally liable negligence
Whether postponing large assessment complete cosmetic renovation good bad often depends neighboring building Sometimes new development depress value older property nearby
Robert Burnett president Burnett Partners advises luxury residential community said community needed spend money regular upgrade homeowner needed periodically update kitchen bathroom house
Its usually capricious decision association club dress facility Mr Burnett said Its really much basic community conceived early 1980s mid1990s
He argued whatever amount assessment least kept real estate value falling But said association needed everything rule includes educating homeowner
Theres instinct matter wealthy spend money said If educate people time give case study majority clearthinking people come around
Even assessment go well work always go smoothly The board Dorchester condominium Pelican Bay 2300acre development Naples Fla voted redo lobby common area hallway Each unit range 560000 34 million double unit overlooking water 12th floor assessed 30005 work
Owners paid one sued said Mr Schroeder Sothebys sale associate representing sale 12thfloor unit But work started everywhere

Theres much anyone point owner voted work failed push done offseason Mr Schroeder said disruption hurt owner typically rented unit winter
Bigmoney battle also mean resident become innocent bystander dispute dont care
Ms Trinkler said buyer research board member understand type assessment levied past
You ask people theyre happy board run really inquire condition building managed said Even still might know youre going get least sense
Looking leap important organizing coup winning costly litigation battle association rare More often lot money spent feeling friendship damaged board way

Still Dreams friendship sunset baseball diamond one thing Throwing softball first time three dozen stranger fingerstiffening temperature entirely another
A middleaged woman dimple pinned number 22 back sweatshirt sent play catch The ball big flew easily hand partner glove It felt good throw familiar even We took turn hitting fielded grounder every base Each time I scooped ball hurled first Each time throw went straight woman mitt
The first month good Our team played week After game wed head bar wed drink beer rehash ump bad call Softball turning exactly I hoped would
And sometime June I started throwing wild
Im sure happened All I know I suddenly found incapable throwing ball
The loss skill complete I never able throw ball life Except I remembered clearly agonizing time throwing natural action body repertoire The motion deeply etched ligament seemed like process happened entirely outside brain
The disappearance something I always good fear would never come back feeling something valuable taken without explanation like losing baseball
It turn sudden inability complete basic motion sport name yip
As I soon discovered Wikipedia yip loss fine motor skill athlete It occurs without apparent explanation And Wikipedia helpfully informed known treatment
Great
I read highprofile case Chuck Knoblauch second baseman hit sportscaster mother face wild ball Mackey Sasser catcher couldnt throw back pitcher without doubletaking
And Steve Blass great pitcher developed yip sent minor I dug Roger Angells 1975 profile The New Yorker read every word hoping uncover secret would change luck There course nothing Mr Blass retired early became jewelry salesmanAt first team chalked nerve
Naomi coach shouted I fielded grounder threw 10 foot right practice Just relax
I tried But problem trying relax try le relaxed feel I tried take time I tried natural I tried focus mechanic I tried focus mechanic I tried think loose I tried think throwing hard I tried really really hard think
Sometimes would work Id land good toss hopefulness would creep But inevitably anxiety would catch soon enough ball would sail past partner sending jogging distance retrieve
After particularly rough game coach pulled aside I desperate tell someone team happening I kind curse baseball skill apparently gone coma wasnt real I thought chance
You know Ive weird problem maybe anxiety This thing happens I cant throw ball
Her face went blank
Dont worry bud get nervous said Just best She patted shoulder headed
The realization came thud To coach I wasnt suffering kind performance anxiety I suckedSo I quit I didnt want damage relationship something source joy I stopped playing baseball I 11 I always carried something I good something one could take away Now seemed opposite true
One weekend I left team partner I made plan go away family Her father semipro pitcher youth
You bring glove said I bet dad would love play
A day later spoke father phone
I told problem said He said thing happened And said need
I readied advice I couldnt use Set foot throw Just relax
But wasnt coming
He said need find wall one around take ball throw wall long time come back All alone
I thought hour I spent kid throwing ball wall old tennis ball parent stoop blue Sky Bounce ball elementary school building recess When went aunt uncle house suburb threw baseball garage door left mark got trouble It kind throwing I longed kind throwing dont think
I didnt bring glove vacation But I stop sporting good store week ago I asked salesman softball soft enough throw wall pointed box neonyellow one
I flung one floor It leapt satisfying easily making way back hand
I bought Its sitting dresser
Theres playground street parent house We used play catch basketball sometimes wed skateboard I havent year But I remember big wide handball wall one seemed rarely used

Theres work lie challenging intersection experimental theater opera film installation art And there man whose railthin physique storm dark hair penchant black tends draw analogy Dostoyevsky character
Last fall St Anns Warehouse Brooklyn strippeddown boldly revisionist ecstatically reviewed staging Oklahoma soldout crowd tapping toe sparkling bluegrass orchestration Rodgers Hammerstein gem Mr Fish could often spotted watching bit grimly seat control booth tightly crossed arm leg pretzeled pose yoga teacher might call Extremely Anxious Auteur
So bit surprising one afternoon earlier month find leaning back almost easefully chair onstage Circle Square hour first dress rehearsal Broadway debut
The crockpots top long table lining side stage ready start bubbling away chili consumed audience intermission Mr Fish bit hoarse relaxed least
The suspicious paranoid part keep waiting shoe drop said asked whether hed make compromise get show Broadway But far gave plywood tabletop first several hard knock I think Ive able lot control work way I like work
Mr Fishs arrival Broadway Oklahoma open April 7 might seem like remarkable turn event artist spent much career running opposite direction American commercial theater
But longtime friend whats remarkable perhaps little experience suddenly finding 52 anointed hot even marketable director changed either darkly iconoclastic vision
I really dont think changed much said Gideon Lester director theater program Bard College show began life 12 year ago scrappy student staging The production though changed whats possible American theater
Mr Fish turn quite genial softspoken conversation grew suburban Tenafly NJ son lawyer mother accountant father also owned summer camp Asked describe kind kid laughed said Oh know weird awkward shy
His parent often took city see Broadway show also work Andrei Serban Peter Brook Mary Testa play Aunt Eller Oklahoma recalled one Mr Fishs quip Im half La MaMa half La Cage Aux Folles
At Northwestern thought would major theater gravitated instead experimental theoretical Performance Studies department credit teacher like Lee Roloff Jungian analyst poetry scholar fostering intensely languagefocused approach theater

It Bard Oklahoma involves audience somewhat restrained way also took shape In 2007 Ms Akalaitis asked Mr Fish idea show threw Rodgers Hammerstein classic remembered fondly childhood suggested mainly like say one else would ever let
He started little concept dinner theater idea audience sitting actual meal cooked onstage
I didnt really much idea beyond said He added Im interested work there real transaction going stage audience Thats thing really turn

Amid frantic lastminute negotiation spray machinegun fire Vladimir Nabokov fled Russia 100 year ago week His family sought refuge Bolsheviks Crimean peninsula force made vicious descent north The chaos pier Sebastopol could match scene met last Russian imperial family evacuated week In Yalta terrified family mobbed quay littered abandoned car Nor Nabokovs accommodation good The Romanovs made escape British manofwar The Nabokovs crowded filthy Greek cargo ship
Overrun refugee Constantinople turned away For several day lurched rough sea subsisting dog biscuit sleeping bench Only family jewelry traveled comfortably nestled tin talcum powder On 20th birthday Nabokov disembarked finally Athens He would never set eye Russia
At time evacuation spent 16 quiet month Crimea last speck Russia White hand Already Bolsheviks murdered number harmless people Nabokovs jurist father son would later note anything harmless In February 1917 riot delivered revolution The czar abdicated replaced liberal government swept power tide popular support Nabokovs father Vladimir Dmitrievich played prominent role administration Months afterward Lenin returned exile disembarking St Petersburgs Finland Station Within year begun idealistic progressive uprising would end like Irans like Egypts totalitarianism With Lenin arrived another 20thcentury staple oneparty system hack henchman replaced competent qualified

A healthy Serena dangerous Serena hasnt healthy year Evert said She still edge power experience
Williams also impressive career record clay active player 17034 Her career winning percentage 833 put ahead Sharapova 815 percent plenty doubt swirling form tennis future age 31
Happy court vulnerable competed since January injury reached tour final since winning Tianjin Open October 2017
Halep best claycourt number last season lead WTA Tours claycourt power ranking give weight recent result
But even close No 1 Halep 27 hardly dominant Oui last year French Open first Grand Slam single title But another claycourt title since Madrid May 2017 tournament surface since Rogers Cup Canada August
Without Darren Cahill coach season Halep looked like resolute selectively aggressive force although run semifinal Miami Open last week encouraging
The biggest prize 2019 gone younger woman age 23
Naomi Osaka 21 year first Grand Slam title Australian Open remains No 1 whisker Belinda Bencic 22 Premier 5 event Dubai Most surprisingly Bianca Andreescu 18 Premier Mandatory event Indian Wells Ashleigh Barty 22 confirmed steady rise winning Miami
Andreescu Barty skill thrive clay strong topspin forehand quick foot ability hit sliced backhand welldisguised drop shot heavy first second serf
But bighitting Osaka losing record clay 911 like call hardcourt player
She also lost momentum since surprising split coach Sascha Bajin Australian Open She hired Venus Williamss former hitting partner Jermaine Jenkins college star reassuring courtside demeanor But Osaka 33 since winning Melbourne loss Kristina Mladenovic Dubai Bencic Indian Wells changeup artist Hsieh Suwei Miami
Novak Djokovic men No 1 also wind face losing early Indian Wells Miami But three Grand Slam single title row difficult disregard memory Djokovic way baseline Nadal Australian Open final
Nadal 32 continues battle body A recurrence tendinitis right knee caused withdraw semifinal Roger Federer Indian Wells At stage know well price pushing pain although pain constant How much longer
Who know Perhaps two three year Toni Nadal uncle former coach said recent appearance Majorca What I say Rafael person play tennis He injured person play tennis difficult
Nadal back training hard Majorca surface forgiving joint hardcourts He schedule defend title Monte Carlo month Djokovic No 5 Dominic Thiem Nadals two obvious rival biggest men claycourt title expected challenge So thirdranked Alexander Zverev fine claycourt record talent win multiple major slumping
Federer back roll age 37 winning Miami intent returning clay threeyear break plan come back Madrid early May training Switzerland
I still think Rafa great place clay said David Macpherson coach John Isner topranked American may miss much claycourt season stress fracture foot The one shown ability break Rafas game time Novak ability smother topspin forehand early pure twohanded backhand negate Rafas strength clay So thats always fascinating matchup
But based plot twist ankle twist 2019 far guarantee decisive matchup
Time watch dust try settle

TOKYO If anyone stir Japanese national pride moment Naomi Osaka
The world No 1ranked player woman tennis Ms Osaka among biggest star Japan splashed across television program advertisement Nissan car Citizen watch As mixedrace person also helped prompt discussion Japanese see country
But looming deadline Ms Osakas 22nd birthday October raised question whether continue represent Japan international tennis circuit given country bragging right world sport stage
Ms Osaka whose mother Japanese father HaitianAmerican citizenship Japan United States Under Japanese law dual citizen must choose two nationality time turn 22
That legal clause left fan commentator trying guess whether Ms Osaka pick citizenship Japan country birth United States lived since young child
The choice facing Ms Osaka come Japan pressure loosen entrenched insularity Japan long prized racial purity seeing largely homogeneous population crucial social cohesion But country population declining employer increasingly desperate worker legislature passed law December admit guest worker starting month
Ms Osakas case along new influx foreigner could exert new pressure government begin bring Japanese citizenship law line roughly threequarters country including United States allow dual citizenship
For though Ms Osaka decision make When asked reporter nationality intended choose responded trademark feistiness
Im pretty sure obvious said news conference following China Open October Im playing Japan Not disrespectful anything I dont really get conclusion hard choice anything come
Still might hard imagine Ms Osaka giving American citizenship keep playing Japanese flag And reality may Legal expert say Japanese government rarely enforces law requiring citizen choose nationality
The Justice Ministry estimate 890000 Japanese citizen may also hold foreign passport government never revoked Japanese citizenship anyone like Ms Osaka granted citizenship birth Japanese citizen voluntarily naturalize another country automatically lose Japanese citizenship
But analyst warn Ms Osakas celebrity would difficult government quietly give pas dual citizenship
I think government problem openly carry two passport said Sachiko Horiguchi associate professor anthropology Temple Universitys Tokyo campus Because mean public would know law isnt really enforced I dont think government want admit public know
Three year ago Renho Murata whose father Taiwan ran first woman lead opposition Democratic Party rightwing critic attacked formally relinquished Taiwanese citizenship
Partly response frenzy Ms Murata Kimi Onoda member Parliament governing Liberal Democratic Party born United States American father Japanese mother formally renounced American citizenship
Ms Osakas multicultural background challenged Japans notion national identity become prominent mixedrace mixednationality figure country one 50 child born year foreign parent Though fluent Japanese captivated country whimsical remark news medium well humility victory
Her parent decided young sister also played would represent Japan partly American tennis federation showed little attention
Anticipating Ms Osakas citizenship choice Michio Ushioda former columnist The Mainichi Shimbun daily newspaper professor Teikyo University Tokyo said Twitter Japan would fall national funk elected American citizenship Japanese
The disappointment Japanese time would great Mr Ushioda wrote tweet select follower could view even suggesting Japans current administration would collapse Ms Osaka competed United States Olympics
Under International Olympic Committee rule competitor must national country represent Similarly International Tennis Federation rule Ms Osaka could play Japan gave Japanese citizenship
Legal expert say Japanese law provides loophole dual citizen effectively retain nationality The law requires Japanese citizen endeavor renounce foreign nationality phrase provide enough wiggle room citizen hold extra passport
Many people misunderstand law feel threatened choose nationality said Yasuhiro Okuda law professor Chuo University
Until 1985 Japan granted citizenship child whose father Japanese When changed law move made pressure international critic said rule discriminated woman government added clause stipulating child dual citizenship would choose passport time turned 22
Analysts say Japans law make little sense modern world filled multicultural citizen like Ms Osaka
It go Japans effort recruit retain global talent said Erin Chung professor East Asian politics Johns Hopkins University Baltimore If basically maintain spirit current nationality act huge deterrent athlete member whats called global talent pool stay Japan
For older generation opening Japan pool newly naturalized citizen could generate considerable political backlash
But younger Japanese growing accustomed living working international neighbor colleague
Young people 20 much familiar foreigner socalled hafu said Satoko Takeda visiting researcher Osaka University Economics Law using Japanese term English word half describe mixedrace descent like Ms Osaka They different previous generation I think hope
