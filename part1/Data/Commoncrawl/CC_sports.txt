Before playoff began used space check six key question would help decide firstround series Portland Trail Blazers Oklahoma City Thunder The Blazers lead series sweeping homegame set figured good time check back six question see Thunder might able reverse trend hurt far potentially get back series move Oklahoma City Here go How Damian Lillard CJ McCollum deal OKCs size pressure So big question Blazers working favor far Lillard particular wilted Pelicans pressure ball last year reversed big way far series Hes scored point two game go along assist he shooting field Oh he taken freethrows Test passed McCollum struggled shooting Game practically burst flame one point Game he got point assist field deep The two guard manipulated Oklahoma Citys pickandroll coverage splendidly alternately using screen rejecting splitting defender scooting around driving rim stepping back hitting shortrollers finding outlet men None Steven Adams Jerami Grant Nerlens Noel able contain either dribble Simply put Thunder cant figure better execute pickandroll defense theyre coming back series Adams Grant leaving far much space ballhandlers either split snake pickandroll either death kind coverage theyre

defensively stay floor That case Game Blazers found way make Oklahoma City need keep mind Donovan said Kanter year ago namely cant play cant hang pickandroll defense Run pickandrolls right every time Blazers take floor Is answer Paul Georges pickandroll snake As noted prior series Paul George Blazers season point rebound assist per game shooting line Theres reason come way Georges preferred method offensive attack work Blazers preferred method guarding pickandrolls Namely Blazers prefer drop big man back paint coax ballhandlers pocket space near elbow George counteracts strategy snaking way

A lot made various team strategy defend James Harden lot focus Milwaukee Bucks broke unconventional tactic ensure Harden drive paint Brook Lopez waited arm raised contest shot rim make Hardens floater difficult However Eric Bledsoe contest behind Lopez protect rim wasnt end Bucks strategy three defender court integrally involved scheme well key objective dissuade Harden throwing pass shooter either corner dribbled paint Mike Prada wrote great breakdown Bucks able succeed containing Harden matchup Rockets season In Game series Houston Utah Jazz employed similar strategy By stationing onball defender Hardens left shoulder able prevent famous step back jumper Rudy Gobert playing Brook Lopez role length better defensive instinct The Jazz dont anybody perimeter combination strength quickness Bledsoe posse Gobert make anything extra Harden get result Utahs le capable perimeter defender Utahs onball defender job Harden funneling correctly toward Gobert relying system stymy However bigger problem Utah came elsewhere Game werent able execute modified version Milwaukees strategy due poor offball defense poor understanding Hardens particular passing skill As pointed elsewhere notably Mike Zavagno Twitter Harden best throwing ball either even body front drive he particularly great seeing open man behind making pas wing he already past free throw line drive rim Milwaukee know move wing defender Harden drive taking away corner pas relying length recovery speed get back wing make pas Of course help Giannis Antetokounmpo team essentially two place defensively change Bucks rotate defensively Hardens isolation drive Utah doesnt anybody replicate Antetokounmpo brings defensively modify Bucks able order put resistance Harden Game beyond Utahs strategy Game put onball defender Hardens left shoulder allow drive Gobert one corner defender sinking onto Capela essentially box able go easy lob This freed Gobert focus solely Harden rather play wont game lob Capela Sinking defender also helped clean glass Jazz guy would continue box shot went The issue arose elsewhere Jazz defender sinking Capela need helped corner When done correctly Rockets precious option Hardens contested floater Gobert The key Mitchell drop Harden prevent pas corner otherwise easy Rockets create consistent opportunity beyond arc Herein lie problem Utah difficult ask Mitchell help Eric Gordon space floor nearly half court side coin giving open corner three PJ Tucker near league leader corner threepoint shooting To combat Utah fully rotate Mitchell following Harden drive take away corner three Ricky Rubio guarding Danuel House top key following Mitchells movement rotate Gordon This leaf House undefended time advantage Utah House worse shooter top key Tucker corner Gordon wing pas House difficult one Harden make Ingles literally standing behind Harden drive rim Should pas float Ingles get House he within step two contesting shot switching onto House time If Ingles take House someone else defend Harden thats Sefolosha come job done Capela dunker spot step take Harden Utah defense worse Further complication arise Harden drive three teammate waiting Capela along dunker spot nobody near corner sink onto In heavyrotation strategy would lowest defender navigate way across paint box Capela anyway step Harden make pas continue box Harden shot attempt Gobert Sefolosha Gobert waiting Harden restricted area opening Capela cut easy finish It seems counterintuitive Sefolosha help far away original mark Harden commits drive rotation Utah Sefolosha neednt concerned Tucker corner thats Mitchells job Sefoloshas new job ensure Capela doesnt get ball either pas offensive glass secondary job step defend Harden Houstons MVP pass perimeter reset offense The rest Jazz rotate need Mitchell sink corner take Tucker Rubio follows defend Gordons spotup threat Ingles already behind Harden House able contest Hardens floater behind position close House needed A heavyrotation strategy would bring issue based alignment Houstons perimeter player In example Harden driving right side floor three Rockets perimeter guy lined left side corner wing top key What Harden driving top teammate spread two corner one wing This problem Utah Jae Crowder sink onto Capela there defender take Tucker circumstance To expect Ingles guarding Chris Paul top key drop defend Tucker might asking bit much Jazz commit heavyrotation defense thats likely would happen If Harden flip ball back Paul Rubio Pauls new defender Crowder disengages Capela pick Harden though Ingles also take Harden based go making pas back Paul Crowder getting back Tucker This tenuous Jazz Ingles would drop way Paul order get done isnt necessarily something team like good reason It would also put lot weight Rubios shoulder contesting behind Harden responsible closing defending Paul might much one player handle even player Ricky Rubio The bet Utah would making spot Harden wont see make pas Paul Hes never particularly adept throwing ball behind perimeter least would make le comfortable knowing exactly open man The difficult setup Utah defend single shooter right corner Capela stationed dunker spot right side rim
