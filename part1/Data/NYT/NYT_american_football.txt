Some healthier patient still need traditional surgery example born two flap aortic valve instead usual three Having two flap lead early aortic valve failure
TAVR tested patient condition occurs often younger patient low surgical risk

Aortic valve replacement performed decade surgeon know valve placed surgery last least 10 15 year It remains seen TAVR valve fare well
The question especially important younger patient The average age subject current study low mid 70 younger decade patient getting TAVR

With move seems prescient two new administrator supervising athletics sought allay concern coach could put undue pressure admission personnel The change also brought oversight athletics case committee senior faculty member dean university representative
The previous arrangement said Philip Ballinger associate vice provost overseeing admission didnt sufficient transparency didnt enough eye
The leeway coach get recruiting long point discussion higher education circle But federal investigator last week revealed broad admission cheating scandal number college began asking hard question evaluate athletic applicant oversee chosen coach recommend admission
In prosecutor described biggest case admission fraud investigated 50 people accused scheme involved paying bribe coach people monitor admission test order fraudulently get child wealthy patron nation elite college
Some student accepted recruited athlete even though play sport described application They gained advantage widespread practice allocating certain number admission spot athlete might get otherwise
This process followed decade pursuit competitive team burnish university reputation inspire alumnus loyalty often help fundraising
Now fraud case sent thunderbolt higher education community
Every college president America called athletic director morning admission fraud story broke asked How make sure doesnt happen school said Bill Martin athletic director University Michigan 2000 retirement 2010 And certain athletic director smart enough call president first insist going start verifying status every admitted recruited athlete
Indeed Yale University FBI investigator say longtime woman soccer coach accepted hundred thousand dollar facilitate admission recruit actually play soccer university president Peter Salovey announced late last week new oversight policy already put place The Yale athletic director begin reviewing every proposed recruit credential admission recruited athlete fail make team arrive receive close scrutiny university statement said
A broad overhaul athletic admission system Division I highest level NCAA competition level college scheme compete overdue according several athletic administrator interviewed recent day
Battles bluechip recruit football basketball already tend heavily scrutinized In upper echelon sport money changing hand coach recruit way around
But lowerprofile sport like crew volleyball tennis soccer often called Olympic sport room bribe exploitation And common route fraud designate phony athletic prospect recruited walkon In nearly every case counterfeit athletic credential cited last week indictment Stanford Texas Yale prospective athlete appeared filling nebulous role recruited walkon
Such applicant even assured spot team But often list five 20 athlete varies sport sport coach permitted submit admission department
The two daughter actress Lori Loughlin charged connection fraud case last week passed crew recruit despite never competed sport according federal prosecutor
That choice sport may accident In sport like woman crew roster balloon 125 athlete many team score recruited walkons Such large roster help college comply federal equality law balancing number male athlete football
When roster big like woman crew I could see would possible coach slip unqualified person recruited walkon said Martin added Michigan annually audited team roster
The recruitment athlete sport may even bigger factor admission process college NCAAs lowest tier Division III athletic scholarship forbidden
Division III also largest tier nearly 450 institution including many country selective small liberal art college acceptance rate low 15 percent These college might field many 30 team enrollment small 2000 varsity athlete many afforded advantage admission making 30 percent 45 percent student body
These small college like largest one also give preferential treatment applicant excel music art host skill There also allowance student leastpopulated state
Admissions filling different bucket said Wendy Smith athletic director Haverford College highly rated institution near Philadelphia And athlete right We way gaming system They absolutely par academically
The cost fielding successful sport team ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often lead troubling conflict interest
In Ivy League example coach responsible fundraising bridge gap support college true price tag competing successfully That lead uncomfortable decision composing team especially since athlete family often become leading donor
You family give 25000 going play daughter said Paul Wardlaw woman tennis coach Brown University 14 year
The whole scandal interesting human nature take easy route said systematic issue contributing
At many elite institution notion recruited athlete granted unfair advantage palpable
Cameron Green tight end football team Northwestern University accepts 13 percent applicant conceded several high school classmate play sport applied Northwestern rejected
Its easier athlete get I know thats hard regular student said Green senior plan play football final year eligibility A lot kid I knew confused I got didnt know end day school look demographic piece paper decides admit even meet
The high percentage recruited athlete college particularly smaller one consequence odds institutional ambition diverse student body
Because success youth sport today often come easily affluent family spend copiously private instruction roster college team become predominantly white nearly 80 percent small school
In end higher education community believe last week admission fraud scandal embarrassing lesson policy change need made nevertheless creating false impression state admission procedure American college
There notion admission competitive cesspool said Michael Reilly executive director American Association College Registrars Admissions Officers In fact Reilly added campus nationwide fail meet enrollment goal But segment thats highly competitive created completely different dynamic If I campus Id sitting saying Lets rethink

But Redoubt rooted unlike expansive work single place remote rugged Sawtooth Mountains landscape Mr Barneys childhood It also speaks directly contemporary American theme place gun fate environment fantasy paranoia turn back constitutional government American society
Lighter freer little conventional usual Mr Barneys engrossing film decade Mr Barney appears supporting role seems especially eager embrace collaboration improvisation notably via dance fascinating addition cinematic technique
Its certainly le visually striking Cremaster cycle River Fundament But I love new open Mr Barney Redoubt Yale University Art Gallery screening Saturday afternoon time alongside exhibition large bronze brass sculpture strange electroplated engraving inspired film The show travel afterward Beijing London
Redoubt cast six draw structure partly tale Ovids Metamorphoses Diana chaste goddess hunt Actaeon doomed young hero spy Diana hunter living grid Idaho attended two dancing Virgins clad militarygrade camouflage favored antigovernment type American west The film title alludes American Redoubt farright survivalist movement region
We first see Diana crafting bullet bronze brass Mr Barney us sculpture awesome backdrop Idahos snowcovered mountain Diana played Anette Wachter worldchampion sharpshooter marksmanship film also prolific gun blogger recently told magazine NRA Family I cant express much I love involved gun industry culture

SEATTLE Howard Schultz faced fullcourt press trouble 2006 began That Seattle SuperSonics lousy worst season 20 year beginning
Though Sonics storied NBA franchise league championship 1979 attendance Seattle arena along point scored revenue earned As team lead owner Mr Schultz facing unrest fan partner alike At time Starbucks coffee company built global giant hit bad patch first ripple Great Recession began rise flood tide
You dont basketball fan know problem Mr Schultz able fix
The Sonics longer exist sold Mr Schultzs group pivotal year later moved Oklahoma City renamed even memorabilia packed away Now Mr Schultz mull running president independent candidate path moment say lot handle adversity uncertainty grasped nettle local politics Sonics flailing according 20 people observed befriended worked year
His basketball legacy left many Seattle outraged day believing Mr Schultz either duplicitous duped others Yet action Starbucks including raft innovation introduced recession like health insurance baristas became stuff adoring Harvard Business School case study In Fortune magazine ranking Starbucks fifthmost admired company world
The common thread deeply familiar people city Mr Schultz called home since early 1980s echoed talk entering politics kind idealistic righteousness combined obvious conviction ability insight All worked like magic wand Seattle except didnt
Theres question built amazing business one Seattle benefited one worldwide reach said Greg Nickels Democrat second term Seattles mayor 2006
The Sonics episode I think different Mr Nickels added I think got discovered thought going
Mr Schultz 65 selfmade billionaire grew public housing Brooklyn said interview conducted request Starbucks decided whether seek White House set deadline A selfdescribed lifelong Democrat Mr Schultz said thought Democrats veering far left President Trump Republicans far right hunger centrist candidacy like one might put
But also said repeatedly recent speech around nation promoting new memoir would run became convinced candidacy could aid Mr Trumps reelection
Indeed announcement January seriously considering running brought outcry many Democrats feared split vote The president chimed tweeting Mr Schultz never sought public office doesnt gut Warren Buffett called Schultz candidacy mistake
As rule American politics independent fail get elected Since Civil War four minorparty candidate president mustered least 10 percent vote Ross Perot George Wallace Robert La Follette Theodore Roosevelt Roosevelt Republican turned Bull Moose candidate 1912 election couldnt win despite popular president year earlier But even getting le 10 percent make difference Ralph Nader showed 2000 election put George W Bush White House Electoral College victory even though Al Gore outgoing vice president popular vote
For part Mr Schultz belief independent president could powerful mandate governing refutation voter bitter divisive politics revenge paralyzed Washington The example could done would turn draw surge likeminded independent candidate would reshape Congress added
The current trajectory demonstrates evidence broken system Mr Schultz said Im looking situation realizing large majority Americans agree
If Mr Schultz run Seattle experience combined back story selfmade success would narrative tell sell Starbucks started different company Mr Schultz said culture defines Pacific Northwest The Sonics failed Seattle story Mr Schultz apologized In universe ventisize place success failure
When Mr Schultz organized investor group buy SuperSonics 2001 took high road rhetoric Sounding like civic patron city loved grubby business moneymaking much afterthought promised treat team kind sacred civic trust
This ownership group get involved make profit said one point testifying Washington State Legislature We wanted passionate people sport passionate people community
That language imagery came back haunt aftermath team demise
Schultz became pariah said Gary Washburn former Seattle sportswriter cover NBA The Boston Globe
In February 2006 Mr Schultz drove State Capitol Olympia plunked front microphone woodpaneled Senate meeting room repeated considered threat might sell Sonics didnt get 200 million public money renovation arena
He said Sonics losing money terrible uncompetitive arena lacking profitable addons franchise like restaurant store Public money lavished sport Seattle past year pointed new play space Mariners baseball team Seahawks football team It time bestow love NBA Mr Schultz said
It go well The Sonics bailout bill even come final vote The political appeal financing athletic venue faded 2000 dotcom economic bust ballot measure aimed reducing taxpayer money professional sport gaining favor even Mr Schultz testified Initiative 91 called approved fall 74 percent majority
Several people Legislature time said Mr Schultz never involved politics lobbying treated like outsider never appeared understand network informal alliance stood way Calls coming legislative office people connected city sport team saying didnt much like idea financing lot expensive new skybox seat
The Mariners Seahawks people terribly encouraging several back channel sort front channel stuff going said James McIntire Democratic state representative time later served two term state treasurer
Art Thiel longtime columnist sportswriter covered Sonics story said Mr Schultz simply didnt understand state capital He thought could pro sport owner sort thing could successful business owner either charm opposition bully said He got neither done
Barely five month hitting wall legislature Mr Schultz made good warning announcing coowners sold team group based Oklahoma moved renamed Thunder
Mr Schultz call decision one major regret life
My biggest mistake still reverberates Mr Schultz wrote recent oped piece The Seattle Times In book elaborates happened Almost everyone blamed initial denial I realized right I squandered public trust I bought
A longtime friend Mr Schultzs Howard Behar former vice president Starbucks said Mr Schultz learned experience warned advance straying world knew might dangerous
When bought company I quote local newspaper Seattle I said No good come I think he nut Mr Behar recalled And I right No good came
The storied name Seattle business world roll tongue world Amazon Boeing Eddie Bauer Microsoft REI Starbucks And Microsoft associated cofounder Bill Gates Paul Allen Amazon founder Jeff Bezos Mr Schultz Mr Coffee father Frappuccino coffee size butchered Italian The venti extralarge mean 20 Italian nod espresso culture Mr Schultz fell love trip Italy 1983
Mr Schultz handed leadership rein company last year came Seattle wife Sheri 1982 take job marketing director Starbucks modest local seller coffee bean Only five year later organized investor group buy company built two stint chief executive retail giant nearly 30000 store around world 380000 employee
But like Seattle vast wealth abundant homelessness leftleaning social environmental policy income tax considerable allotment billionaire Schultz legacy mixed
At first Seattle appearance announcing presidential consideration protester gathered outside downtown theater promoting new memoir The protester waved sign venti ego failed billionaire politician audience inside cheered almost every whispered hint presidential run
In charitable civic work Schultz Family Foundation force homeless advocacy working shelter group youthtraining center Seattle datadriven approach moving homeless family street quickly stable housing
The foundation piloted something proved worked said Marty Hartman executive director Marys Place nonprofit shelter provider received 45 million Starbucks Schultz foundation
But measure civic engagement like bothering vote Mr Schultz le involved Of 40 election held since 2003 could participated Seattle resident voted 12 time according King County record
Im remiss course I vote local election know I travel much Mr Schultz said interview though quickly added never missed chance vote president

Read profile Terry Gross host Fresh Air
Eventually Stevess busy New York day ended Upper East Side scheduled give talk Barnes Noble As drove event Steves confessed wasnt sure kind crowd would get You never knew exactly Rickniks hardcore fan call would materialize en masse Some Steves appearance mobbed others sparse His appeal slightly cultish For every Ricknik world large contingent average people idea
I mildly skeptical Stevess drawing power New York It hard imagine bunch cynical worldly urban polyglot multicultural East Coast sophisticate people probably vacationed deconsecrated ecohostels Oman Madagascar getting excited public television reigning expert Europe
We arrived however find bookstore overflowing A solid wave applause met Steves door Fans pouring organizer told u two solid hour People sat aisle stood back Some wore Tshirts hat bearing Rick Steves slogan Keep Travelin The crowd body heat overwhelmed building climate control
I noticed group hipster 20somethings standing near back first I assumed come sarcastically But Steves began speak grinned laughed absolute earnestness Everyone apparently superfan At one point Steves showed slide tourist swimming sunny French river underneath Roman aqueduct whole crowd gasped When mentioned website featured special video devoted packing light woman woman crowd actually pumped fist
At end talk Steves offered sign book traditional way There many people signing table said anyway singlefile line always inefficient This one travel credo avoid waiting line Instead sitting Steves walked center room invited everyone open book surround He pulled Sharpie And started spin Steves held pen signed book book book fluidly move smiling crowd pressed We went Portugal honeymoon man shouted How romantic Steves answered still spinning A woman asked celebrate Christmas Europe Steves midrotation still signing furiously told made whole special precisely question available free website Keep travelin Rick someone shouted Keep travelin Steves shouted back As spun Steves thanked everyone gave quick offthecuff advice In astonishingly short time signed every book The people satisfied The crowd thinned Steves finally came stop
Rick Steves absolutely American He wear jean every single day He drink frozen orange juice He like hash brown burned coffee extra hot He dislike fancy restaurant he road prefers buy footlong Subway sandwich split lunch dinner He great spontaneous honk laugh burst truly delighted sharpness firecracker Fourth July Steves completely American stop really look name realize name Rick followed plural Steve oneman crowd absolutely regular everyday American guy one Rick many Steves Although Steves spends nearly half life traveling insists passionately would never live anywhere United States know say absolutely true In fact Steves still life small Seattle suburb grew every morning walk work block downtown parent owned piano store 50 year ago On Sundays Steves wear jean church play conga great armpumping spirit inspirational softrock band serenade congregation service start sits sings classic Lutheran hymn without even needing refer hymnal Although Steves published many foreignlanguage phrase book language speaks fluently English He built business America raised kid America give frequent loving paean glory American life
And yet Rick Steves desperately want leave America The tiniest exposure outside world belief change entire life Travel Steves like say wallop ethnocentricity carbonate experience rearranges cultural furniture Like sealed window hot day nation border stultifying Steves want crack open let humanity breeze circulate The rootedly American Rick Steves want If never passport afraid world family would prefer vacation exclusively Walt Disney World worry foreigner rude predatory prone violence least food give diarrhea Steves want especially go Europe Then want go beyond For majority audience Steves say Europe wading pool world exploration Perhaps like need large headphone half tab Ambien properly relax flight Steves want know worth He want stand make little moaning sound cobblestone street first time taste authentic Italian gelato flavor pure seem like primordial essence peach melon pistachio rice distilled molecule stirred directly molecule He want hike dirt path along cliff almosttooblue Mediterranean village vineyard spilling rugged mountain He want arrive Parthenon dusk close tour group loading back onto cruise ship whole place stand feeling like private witness birth ruination Western civilization
Steves want go Europe long afford also want help afford Much guru energy focused cutting cost He want go many time possible youre want get way deep culture eat local teeming market make sympathetic fool get entirely lost lack America
Out paradoxical desire enlightenment Americans extraction America Steves built quirky travel empire His guidebook started handtyped photocopied information packet scraggly 1970s tour group dominate American market distinctive blueandyellow spine brighten travel section bookstore everywhere Steves le interested reaching sophisticated traveler converting uninitiated There rejoicing heaven one sinner repents Bible tell u 99 righteous person need repent Last year company led close 30000 paying customer dozen elaborate European itinerary Steves teach follower everything pack toiletry kit make home small hotel room appreciate religious tradition may raised despise In order enjoy St Peters Basilica Steves admits learn park Protestant sword door He sort spiritual travel agent Americas curious hesitant middle class He simultaneously goofy dead serious ping instant gollygee Pollyanna cheerfulness deep critique modern world In series long affectionate candid conversation Stevess colleague described using word sophomoric knucklehead Santa Claus also juggernaut evangelical revolutionary Rick Steves want u travel fun yes also belief might actually save world
I testify firsthand power Rick Steves In 1998 spoke college Nothing encounter seemed promising Our campus tiny outpost tiny town Steves delivered talk grand lecture hall drab room basement student union I poor shy anxious sheltered repressed extremely pale I particular kind Pacific Northwest white guy blind place world I never really traveled I comfortable Greyhound bus airplane Going Europe seemed like something aristocrat like fox hunting debutante ball
My girlfriend dragged talk I never even heard Steves He entered looking like kind guy would bring acoustic guitar every single church picnic within twohour radius favorite Applebees large glass floppy hair bluejeans wholesome grin But said next hour changed rest life
Its hard describe thoroughly energized Steves becomes front crowd He pace gesticulates speaks fast He tell favorite old joke eternally new Eet smell like zee foot angel French cheesemonger always exclaims Onstage combination preacher comedian salesman lifehacker professor inspirational speaker Steves told u day pack entire life single bag measuring 9 22 14 inch Its enlightened pack light Steves insists Its blessing pack light He told u find excellent cheap hotel survive minimalist picnic public park wash clothing bathroom sink make friend without sharing language Stevess signature book Europe Through Back Door seemed le like travel philosophy whole mode scrappy prepared independent extroverted Europes front door told u positioned feed traveler directly exploitation overpriced cafe trinket shop long line corporate highrise hotel The back door contrast led revelation He showed u impossibly enticing photo cobblestone piazza teeming fruit stall quirky wooden hotel among wildflower Alps vast arsenal multicolored cheese He made travel seem le like luxury necessary exploration self civic responsibility basic courtesy fellow human It seemed almost unreasonable go Above Steves told u afraid The people world wonderful planet share spectacular But way really understand go see So go
My girlfriend I left room convert gospel Rick Steves We bought book highlighted nearmeaninglessness We started mapping itinerary squirreling away money asking relative donation In probably worst phone call life rancher grandfather expressed shock dismay I would ask support meaningless overseas lark Eventually many month scraped together enough buy plane ticket order minimalist Stevesapproved supply including travel towel thin nonabsorbent seemed push moisture around skin forgot wet We packed exactly Steves taught u Tshirts rolled spacesaving noodle enough clothes get u one hotel laundry session next Then first time life left North America
One Stevess strongest recommendation keep journal Mine corny cover actually said A TRAVELERS NOTEBOOK picture Eiffel Tower When I opened recently reality longago trip hissed fresh urgency My 20yearold self recorded everything On first day Europe bought imported Austrian apple fat heavy English coin saw woman stumble staircase breaking entire bag newly bought china We arrived first hostel YMCA Bath find man urinating stairwell kept walking happened nearby churchyard gravestone old thin almost translucent As tried make name dead songbird sang strenuously tree around u This juxtaposition old death new life blew jetlagged American mind Already one day Bath I wrote journal world grown firmer Reality fill gap
That le theme trip For six week followed Steves game plan We shared squalid bunk young traveler Denmark Australia Canada Japan In stately public park Paris ate rotisserie chicken bare hand One stifling afternoon Colosseum Rome watched worker slam ladder edge arch break ancient brick He looked u looked brick kicked dirt kept working We moved Van Gogh Picasso Gaudí unmoved Versailles vain beautiful I wrote bullfighting brutal artful Goya vague blurry Once I left underwear Mediterranean beach overnight since I could afford lose pair go back pick next day full view sunbather
Wherever went Rick Steves u In journal I referred halfjokingly worldly uncle guiding light walked around I annoyed girlfriend impression We seemed entered world slide fruit market overnight train sunny French river ancient Roman aqueduct Sometimes European host quiet pride someone met Elvis told u story Steves He gentleman said truly good man always came person check hotel never failed ask child
By end trip completely broke We couldnt afford even baguette last day Paris We flew home looking ragged shaggy weatherbeaten exhausted


But course Steves right Our life never We still young Americans felt liberated empowered like true citizen world The important thing learned home As English writer GK Chesterton put quote I found printed corny old travel journal The whole object travel set foot foreign land last set foot one country foreign land After looking Roman stone wall topped Saxon stone wall topped medieval English wall next modern paved street I began see thin crust national history United States actually stand I began realize silly narrow notion exceptionalism impulse consider somehow immune force shape rest world The environment I grew mall freeway fantasy heroic individualism began seem unnatural I started sense much reality exists elsewhere world theoretical sense book movie full urgent weight real And Europe every continent time forever I began realize much I still learn I could pretend understand anything Not everyone need Stevess help get point Some people get community help But I needed I eternally glad I dragged day see talk
How eat Venice like Venetian
Steves answered front door slightly distracted I come middle breakfast preparation He stirring block frozen orange juice pitcher water Freshly squeezed quipped This April 2018 exactly 20 year first trip Europe I come see Steves exotic place possible home He life north Seattle town rainy free umbrellashare program There nothing particularly exotic house It beige carpeting professionally trimmed shrub back deck hot tub What exotic simply Steves He returned frenetic speaking tour United States would leaving almost immediately annual trip Europe For making breakfast frozen blueberry Kashi cereal OJ I would eat every day rest life I could said
But course could Steves gone much yoyoing misty forest Pacific Northwest sunbaked cathedral Europe Every year matter else going Steves spends least four month practicing kind travel preached 40odd year hauling backpack narrow staircase cheap hotel washing clothes sink improvising picnic
He 63 could afford retire many time But doesnt metabolism sitting around Among colleague Steves notorious workaholic After grueling day filming Europe known slip script revision crew door 2 ask breakfast feedback On long car ride sits back seat type opeds laptop His relentless handson control every aspect business distinguished Rick Steves brand
It also obviously exhausting Steves least people around He two child grown much childhood Steves gone He building company changing world For long stretch wife forced single mother She Steves divorced 2010 25 year marriage Every summer family joined Steves Europe pace hardly slackened They would cover major city 48 hour blitzing huge museum back back The kid complained much one trip Steves finally snapped miserable said could go sit hotel room day play video game They remember day heaven One year Steves away child converted Catholicism His son Andy Steves eventually went family business He work tour guide even published European guidebook
Steves fully aware obsessive work ethic unusual He admits regret But make stop He fervor true evangelist The people meet city visit life might change At one point talked pulled itinerary coming trip Sicily Iceland time whatsoever Just looking made giddy I asked couldnt ease slightly maybe spend two month Europe maybe speak 10 American city
Its strange thing said I get energy Its like Im breathing straight oxygen What would I I stayed home Not much Nothing I would remember
In house Steves offered little show tell He pointed antique silver cigarette lighter shaped like Space Needle He sat baby grand piano lost happy minute playing Scarlatti He took room filled book reached high shelf I dont show many people said theyll think Im nut Steves pulled thick red binder content indeed pretty nutty When Steves 13 decided apparent reason conduct deep statistical analysis 1968 Billboard pop chart Every week would clip ranking local newspaper using point system devising graph top band success sheet gridded paper The line multicolored interwoven looked like subway map fantastical foreign city You could see glance rising falling fortune Beatles red Creedence Clearwater Revival black Elvis Presley dot dash Steves kept three year taping together many piece graph paper end summarized data authoritativelooking table typed family typewriter This binder systematic breakdown successful band 1968 1970 determined objective statistic analytical adolescent weirdo The winner course Beatles 1739 point followed Creedence Simon Garfunkel Neil Diamond
Steves laughed It ridiculous But also perfect window mind Even 13 powerful energy coiled inside unusual combination obsession precision waiting worthwhile project burst
And coincidentally exactly found project life In summer 1969 Steves 14 parent took Europe They owned business tuning importing piano wanted see factory firsthand Steves approached first trip abroad meticulous energy brought Billboard graph As traveled around continent recorded essential data journey back postcard location activity weather expense One day Steves spent 40 cent fishing gear Another met 79yearold man witnessed assassination Archduke Franz Ferdinand To keep everything order Steves numbered postcard sequentially He still packed lovingly old wooden box
On formative trip Steves family visited relative Norway They happened July 1969 Neil Armstrong walked moon Ett lite skritt et menneske television said ett stort sprang menneskeheten In moment strange place young Rick Steves felt concept menneskeheten mankind depth never would able access back home Europe crash course cultural relativity In park Oslo epiphany The foreign human around realized leading existence every bit rich full Right would write later 14yearold egocentric worldview took huge hit A lifechanging realization clicked place This planet must home billion equally lovable child God
That first trip set course everything followed When Steves 18 went back Europe without parent Soon life America became series interlude travel He taught piano earn money stretched money far possibly could sleeping church pew park bench empty barn construction zone Western Europe Afghanistan He turned cheapness science Instead paying hotel room city Steves would use Railpass sleep train night four hour four hour back He would stuff free breakfast bread try eat little possible rest day Naturally recorded today impressive archive old travel journal Their page preserve tiny handwriting shadowy young dissident Moscow diarrhea Bulgaria revolution Nicaragua
In 20 Steves brought wideroaming wisdom back United States He started supplement piano teaching travel seminar His signature class European Travel Cheap ran six hour Steves could talked longer struck impractical student In Europe rented nineseat minibus started lead small tour Eventually seminar tour note morphed book The first edition Europe Through Back Door published 1980 typed rented IBM Selectric It ISBN looked amateurish bookstore assumed early review copy Anyone caught reprinting material herein purpose whatsoever thanked profusely said This birth Rick Steves empire
Rick Steves TV persona Offscreen allows much explicitly political He passion autodidact Growing Steves led relatively sheltered existence He white comfortable middleclass baby boomer white comfortable middleclass pocket America Travel promise everyone else It put contact reality He saw desperate poverty Iran became obsessed economic injustice He started searching answer book scribbling note margin Bread World Arthur Simon The Origins Totalitarianism Hannah Arendt He studied war industry colonial exploitation The first time Steves traveled Central America came back outraged wrote fiery tract called Theres Blood Your Banana flew Washington handdelivered copy office every member Congress
In early day Steves injected political lesson European tour Sometimes would arrive city hotel reservation make privileged customer feel anxiety homelessness In Munich would set camp infamous hippie circus tent among countercultural wanderer Europe
Today Steves strategic His powerful tool realizes broad appeal He uncanny knack making serious criticism feel gentle friendly Often disguise critique America rhetorical move I like think USA USA USA But Im unapologetically proud American writes introduction book Travel Political Act The happiest day trip day I come home But nation pretty good idea
Thats hit audience legal prostitution high tax rate universal health care
When I asked Steves strategy chuckled
Its Americabashing said Its Americaloving I think loving America look critically But youve got set Youve got allay people concern youre communist So explain Im capitalist I make lot money I employ lot people I love law supply demand It seems kind silly youve got say Then especially husband dragged wife go I thought commie he OK And dont need gentle You confront people different perspective youll get
Steves learned strategy said early day running tour living people week time Survival required pleasant People didnt want grating lecture Americas shortcoming even sometimes instinct Instead pointed different perspective smile He became fluent need American tourist I know button said I know attention span I dont want preach choir I want preach organization need hear I need compromise little bit gatekeeper let world
This balancing act become increasingly difficult past two decade world terrorism war nationalism metastasizing partisanship After Sept 11 attack travel company anticipated bottom fall market They canceled tour cut back budget Steves however remained defiantly optimistic He promised staff would cut layoff shift message He insisted world crisis needed travel le Soon shock Sept 11 turned Iraq war strained relationship United States even closest European ally sending travel industry deeper trough In hometown Steves caused controversy walked around removing row American flag set support war It argued act patriotism The flag meant represent Americans war supporter I sharkbait Seattles rightwing radio talk show several day wrote
Lately Steves concedes political message begun take teaching In Travel Political Act familiar element guidebook walking tour museum guide hotel review replaced rabblerousing cultural critique Steves express deep admiration Scandinavianstyle social democracy call many Americas fault addiction car gun mass incarceration deference corporation long history cultural imperialism one ugliest thing one nation write another nation textbook Some moment book verge unAmerican Sometimes Im frustrated impact American foreign policy developing world Steves writes I feeling impotent America better world America whose power isnt always used good
Occasionally despite best effort Steves still ruffle feather Recent TV special covered Iran I believe youre going bomb place Steves written know people first rise fascism Europe In special Holy Land Steves refers unapologetically Palestine instead West Bank Palestinian territory viewer outraged told Steves removing PBS will After one recent speech Deep South event organizer refused pay Steves conservative sponsor learned considered message form liberal propaganda
In recent year Steves become happy warrior unlikely cause legalization marijuana He first tried drug Afghanistan 1970s name cultural immersion fascinated effect mind Today board member Norml National Organization Reform Marijuana Laws regular speaker Hempfest In headquarters find poster Mona Lisa holding gargantuan spliff In 2012 Steves campaigned hard Washington States successful legalization initiative since barnstormed state Oregon Maine Vermont make sure civil liberty properly passed around On shelf living room right among European knickknack Steves display sizable bong

A weeklong trip Alaska supposed adventure In instant became experience defined u
By JON MOOALLEM
DAVID BENJAMIN SHERRY
The whale sighting happened right away minute Day 1 Jon Dave I dropped remote Alaskan shoreline hour half boat closest speck town Jon working seakayaking guide summer Glacier Bay National Park invited u sevenday excursion week As boat delivered u vanished drone engine dampening murmur finally trailing became unthinkably quiet beach largeness strangeness surroundings suddenly apparent It familiar phenomenon Jon start trip moment people instinctually paused soak To felt like scene astronaut finally rattled free earth atmosphere slip stillness space Except werent space We earth finally really earth
We starting move around packing gear kayak heard first huff blowhole far offshore
Jon ecstatic It seemed animal putting show swimming playfully kelp diving resurfacing plowing open mouth across surface feed He took good omen Though I idea time anxious Dave I might feel intimidated making trip big payoff quickly would get u excited defuse apprehension
For Dave whalesighting exactly opposite effect Once kid dad took scuba diving dolphin They friendly aweinspiring creature purportedly terrified Dave instead He could still conjure feeling hanging defenselessly water animal deftly swirled around le like solid object flash reflected light could move comparative slowmotion Ever since harbored fear large sea creature niche phobia particularly young man lived Bronx genuine one still And even Dave understood chance see whale close like major draw kayaking trip Alaska though feigned thrilled second thought kicking We going realized
The whale left exhilarated gleeful like Jon deeper I also remember feeling shaken like Dave Nothing animal registered playful welcoming It appeared distance transited quickly past u left right My uneasiness something whale great size indifference obliviousness passed Watching made feel profoundly place register large wilderness relative
At time I working literary magazine New York City called The Hudson Review picking poem slush pile mailing outside panel editorial adviser I trying hard letter impress one Hayden Carruth gruff irreverent 81yearold poet lived far upstate I loved Carruths work enamored persona yeoman life wood intolerance phoniness precision articulated common suffering including one strain suffering I related particularly year wouldnt courage clarity examine
I always aware Carruth wrote youth Universe sad everything animate inanimate wild creature stone star enveloped great sadness pervaded Never I able look cloudless sky night see beauty A kind grandeur yes beauty The profusion variety celestial light always frightened Why Why instead others Why instead nothing
That I felt watching whale beach afraid everything accident Then maybe hard picture start trip retrospect without amplifying feeling foreboding Something else Carruth wrote always stuck The wilderness begin edge body edge consciousness extends edge universe filled menace

It midAugust 2002 23 24 25 We graduated college together two year earlier Dave I also grew shot undergrad knowing wanted doctor finished first year medical school Any similar momentum I graduation instantly sapped Three night I returned parent house school I found driving father emergency room Three week died My grief disorienting total moment life everything supposed feel possible making single decision became impossible I gave sadness better part year resettling home New Jersey widowed mother sliding back summer job I worked school glumly breaking beef butcher shop two town
I coped fatherlessness confusion way Im proud still dont understand I read lot book Ronald Reagan example even collection love letter Nancy I also lashed Dave living home summer studying MCAT He withdrew awkwardly funeral I suppose I happy hold It triggered longstanding jealousy A part always resented seemed unfairly exempt selfdoubt heaviness I prone
Jon meanwhile teaching rustic little boarding school Switzerland mother The summer graduation starting job set Alaska friend sleeping bed old pickup In minuscule town Gustavus gateway Glacier Bay picked seasonal work warehouse kayaktour company Jon little actual experience sea kayaking always felt drawn ocean abstract In college another friend plotted paddling expedition near Glacier Bay across border Canada applied grant school fund The grant set memory alumnus died avalanche mountaineering It meant encourage responsible conscientious pursuit wilderness expedition Safety key But committee rejected Jon partner application They seemed insufficiently prepared
That wasnt surprising Jon grew lot backcountry camping competent outdoorsman putting together grant application required kind administrative fastidiousness didnt always posse He bright scatterbrained forever picking thing putting figuratively music project conversation also literally I still picture hustling around house shared college hunting key soldering iron gotten head rewiring device He artist one piece I remember consisted halfpeeled banana implanted circuitry suspended jar formaldehyde Once grew grass upstairs bathroom living bathmat said turf became muddy flooded downstairs
This Jons third summer Alaska hed worked way leading expedition taking vacationer day time Our trip however would venture beyond typical circuit remote corner park hed never Jon serious concern safety felt bore responsibility emotional wellbeing To enjoy would need feel comfortable wilderness also leader
He suspected wouldnt trust entirely We didnt We knew became professional guide perception expertise lagged behind reality With Jon Dave told always unclear extent hed thought everything Dave remembered landing Gustavus night got underway casually asking Jon lot question Where going exactly Do everything need Jon seemed solid answer As headed back place good night sleep told u wait yard He living alone summer house acquaintance building wood The structure framedup largely wallless Jon safe needed check moose wandered
After spectacular first day paddling came ashore rocky tidal flat two mile dropped Jon gave u detailed tutorial bear safety set campsite He taught u example holler Hey bear heard rustling also preventively ahead u walked wood The last thing wanted come across brown bear unannounced
Hey bear Jon kept hollering way demonstration He said goofily like childrens TV host greeting downonhisluck ursine neighbor doorway clubhouse This intentional Jon noticed people trip often resisted bellowing Hey bear wilderness It essential safety felt silly vulnerable somehow like singing public So learned turn shtick spinning streamofconsciousness narration Hey bear Im coming tree Hope youre fantastic evening Mr Bear It loosened everyone They performing friend whole group joke
I never seen wild bear though I backpacked bear country handful time I felt comfortable animal abstract But bear werent abstract breached material plane There bear trail everywhere leading tree line water disquietingly close I felt pitching tent We found heap scat We saw tree animal slashed bark eat inner layer tuft fur paw still plastered sap
I pretended I fun But evening I grew increasingly petrified almost delirious My eye tightened scanning bear The sound wind became bear mossy stick cracking foot I gave migraine phased sleep
At sunrise I woke feeling foolish While Jon cooked pancake I reasoned privately notebook I brought trip I tried conceive situation geometry problem Yes number bear roved landscape I wrote relatively tiny independent blip going business randomly like u In empty space confusion lethal collision moving blip moving blip would improbable coincidence Id distorting odds mistaking absolute focus bear attention I wrote It embarrassing really To afraid bear I concluded narcissistic
I reminding freakishly horrible thing definition unlikely happen Even reasoning feel sound

Day 2 slog We paddled spitting drizzle endless straight line along high granite wall coast We talked le le pushed emerald chop Then eventually gave hauling boat making camp wide crescentshaped cove short site Jon originally picked map
We entered Dundas Bay rarely visited pocket national park Ive since learned storied history hideout solitary misanthrope In 1930s one prospector built cabin far campsite brandished gun Alaska Natives passed
We intuited scenery beautiful could see little fog Our guidebook explained east side bay get extremely rough foul weather since large wave roll batter shoreline That happening The weather plinked u afternoon roiling storm Soon big rain started We rushed dinner loafed tent eventually loafing turned sleep
A local newspaper would later describe storm short intense In Gustavus creek swelled foot higher previous record Gale wind gust 59 mile per hour turned back two cruise ship Skagway 85 mile north Around 2 woke discover wind shorn rain fly tent Jons sleeping bag mine soaked Dave snug dry u We heard torrent water lashing wave crashing cove
We got three four hour later The rain wind longer felt ferocious still gnarly paddle question Jon said staying put We cooked breakfast took turn playing chess tent By late morning storm seemed passed We antsy We figured would take look around
The terrain crammed thicket alder spruce underlain fern furor prickly thing Jon pointed devil club three four foot tall leafy armored spine The plant pierced fleece hurt like fire
There trail Wed trudging time reached fastmoving stream maybe 10 foot wide Jon surprised wasnt map likely drainage bloated storm We followed downstream looking way across eventually found bridged hefty tree trunk It seemed like easy crossing Jon stepped led way Dave I waited singlefile line stream bank behind The creek loud like factory gear roller churning Looking Jon realized water hed thought
Thats I heard snap wood behind After paranoia I instantly understood many bear Id thought I heard absolutely bear nothing sound unmistakable crisp explicitly something I turned hollered Hey bear waited beat Maybe I said Hey bear Im sure But I must scanned tree long enough feel satisfied safe I know I turning head go back friend I saw dark shape rushing forward peripheral vision
What I heard must root popping If tree large enough apparently hear cracking underground like gunfire
The thud seismic The trunk crashed right next Mapping bit evidence later concluded tree must 80 foot tall perhaps two foot diameter It kind conifer spruce cedar I screamed involuntarily Look watched Dave step directly front dive sideways hit ground When I got crouching stunned OK He looked said Go get Jon
It hadnt clicked back There three u The sight Dave going canceled everything else I scrambled creek running across tree fallen shouting Jons name spotted water tangled snarl shearedoff branch near bank behind cage kept hurtling downstream
He know hed hit falling tree It narrowly missed head struck left shoulder shearing collarbone breaking many rib Later doctor would explain downward force powerful probably squashed Jons entire upper body organ inside toward waist momentarily compressing like bellow split second shoulder headed direction bellybutton torso sprang
Jon heard nothing seen nothing He turning around help Dave onto log feeling responsible safety next thing knew water He tried reach left arm could make move He could move leg He felt bolt pain spine
Jon later described flashing idiosyncratic sequence thought millisecond watching deck card fanning across table One image wheelchair sitting behind mixing console fancy recording studio I guess I become recording engineer wheelchair remembered thinking He never worked recording studio though played music particular plan Still vision apparently felt like acceptable future freed resurface present That registered screaming name
Jon told shouldnt move He knew many wilderness firstresponder training moving person spinal injury risk paralysis Then also knew body submerged cold water recognized risked dying hypothermia didnt move If Im already paralyzed concluded I may well move
He somehow hoisted stream Dave I got using right arm chin biting something loamy teeth additional leverage He reassessed situation better Also worse He realized least mile inland camp
Suddenly body walking leg started working Dave I put u supporting frame He moving faster expected uncoordinatedly Then crumpled u We tried Jon dead weight Dave noticed breathing shallow voice low sign Dave knew med school collapsed lung He began battering Jon pep talk telling firmly get get Jon didnt need explained cogent still trying plot next step mind He looked see log resting lumpy realized fact sitting left arm The arm slack obviously broken sleeve pierced devil club Jon zero feeling He found amusing sensation complete estrangement one limb
Jon stressing important stay together But another theory wilderness survival appeared breaking practice Someone would get radio back camp By chance marooned tent rainstorm night Jon showed u use device though almost formality handheld VHF unit merely lineofsight radio told u meaning range small signal weak pas obstacle You unlikely reach anyone couldnt see hadnt seen anyone since faraway fishing boat early Day 1
There moment discussion maybe exchange look Dave I told Dave go I didnt trust find way back I also knew I lacked courage try whether I sensible cowardly I still dont know Besides I took granted Dave would make He capable mind le likely cinch indecisive knot
Recently though Dave told You probably idea much head I I know growing definitely felt insecure thing I think looked thought Dave everything figured But I much anxiety He brought tremor used hand I knew high school waited table together I occasionally carry Daves soup order wouldnt spill But I guess I thought tremor strictly physiological I couldnt see vulnerability causing
Now Dave sprinted away Jon swatting devil club path rubberized sleeve rain jacket nerve rose rattled He worried wouldnt able find radio got back know turn What broke radio foreclosing whatever marginal chance getting help There lot way screw Dave realized More occurred ran
He found radio He turned Then solved problem encountered another hadnt anticipated What appropriate thing youre supposed say remembered thinking On TV see lot people saying Mayday And Dave faced open water started broadcasting fog Mayday Mayday Even moment though alone beach middle nowhere felt slightly selfconscious This goddamn cliché thought
Back wood kneeling Jon I problem I didnt know say He lying near log injured side beard glass flecked dirt tendril moss He seemed brink losing consciousness At time would possibility Jons dying surface concretely mind Still I knew I supposed keep talking tether world voice somehow
I started vamping platitude We going get soon forth But I could feel treading water even blundering one point longwinded apology worried I overstayed welcome one Christmas family I afraid helplessness voice might counterproductive unsettling Jon instead steadying It tremendous silence fill
What person say I two literature professor college made u memorize poem You never knew line verse would come handy claimed One liked brag traveling Ireland found spat Yeats pub could drink free This I wound reciting love poem Jon
It The Shampoo Elizabeth Bishop lyric poem enormity time turn startlingly intimate end Bishop offer shampoo lover silvering hair Come let wash big tin basinbattered shiny like moon
After I imagine I also WH Auden I knew fair amount Auden back The stuff rhyme meter always easiest memorize Looking star I know quite wellThat care I go hell I lot Robert Frost disposal well Stopping Woods Snowy Evening The Road Not Taken For part I trafficked hit
Jon I would spend hour half together alone forest floor I ran everything quiver Kay Ryan AR Ammons Michael Donaghy padding poem little prefatory remark Jon said nothing signaled eye produced sound whenever I checked I felt like radio DJ playing record middle night unsure anyone listening And here one owl Richard Wilbur I would tell Jon would go
I must also done least one Hayden Carruth curmudgeonly pen pal literary magazine Carruths poem didnt lend memorization Id worked hard nail one favorite describes stopping notice deer standing apple thicket realizing northern light flaring overhead Hayden animal pas moment stillness together We proud afraid writes proud sharethe silent magnetic storm destroys star Relative boundless violence deer momentarily allied though still entirely connected glimpse acknowledgmentit enough never enough
Thats I said friend powerlessly tenting jacket face started rain The title poem I Know I Remember But How Can I Help You
The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasnt supposed The 110foot patrol boat normally spent time coursing Gulf Alaska inspecting halibutfishing vessel circulating terrorist deterrent near oil terminal Valdez It homeported Seward hundred mile Glacier Bay But crew transiting Juneau training day earlier smacked storm later poured inland u We gotten absolutely pummeled John Roberts petty officer Mustang told recently For two day boat swished around 15footplus sea Many crew hunkered mess deck vomiting Roberts couple shipmate best cover everyones watch Finally Mustang slipped Glacier Bay find protection The weather started ease That afternoon Roberts piloted Mustang east toward Dundas Bay pallid crewmates finally staggering back bridge asking hell
That Daves Mayday call came The signal Mustangs radio thin faint barely edging range Another ship petty officer Eamon McCormack explained retrospect connection feel mindboggling Glacier Bay National Park extends 5000 square mile Our signal would covered two three mile And yet boat Coast Guard boat le happened passing exceedingly small window precisely right time I dont know nine time 10 play outcome would McCormack said A moment earlier later second potentially might slipped alignment The moving boat would cruised range uncoupling u forever


It 125 pm Mustang received Daves call according one subsequent Coast Guard report Roberts couldnt believe Come man Im tired said aloud wearily receiver front Roberts waited moment per protocol chance Coast Guards central communication center Juneau would pick call instead Then turned asked watch commander pull standardized searchandrescue paperwork He steeling resummoning professionalism I guess said
Roberts crew member Mustang current medical training would complete EMT certification following month As started firing question Dave radio didnt like answer heard coming back shallowness Jons breathing likelihood punctured lung More fundamental Roberts remembered Any time tree fall somebody good He also unsettled learn Dave I lived New York City red flag found someone wind trouble wilderness
We 100 nautical mile nearest hospital halfday trip even ideal condition The Mustang requested Coast Guard Air Station Sitka send helicopter immediate plan Roberts three crewmates peel toward shore ship Zodiac track u Dave found flare Jons emergency kit 220 Zodiac underway Coast Guard asked fire He still front campsite facing water Hed never shot flare He aimed straight watched bright tracer rose arced somewhere far behind deep wood He uncertain whether counted success He started scanning fog front Zodiac never appeared
Someone Mustang caught sight flare near end arc immediately directed crew Zodiac toward steering far away Dave opposite side little peninsula wed camped And yet lucky wound coming ashore much closer I waiting wood Jon Soon whatever poem I reciting interrupted whistle blowing voice calling eventually three shape wearing hard hat heavy orange rain gear rushed toward u tree
Roberts especially impressive reassuringly large Bostonarea native booming voice He knelt took Jons vitals The information troubling pulse 60 beat per minute breathing fast shallow They put neck brace eased onto kind truncated backboard called Miller board move beach Dave returned He I crouched one end board near Jons foot someone presumably Roberts bellowed count three lift
Later night lying sleep bedandbreakfast Gustavus stunned depleted dry warm Dave I would talk talk reviewing entire ordeal We drooped long silence coasting toward sleep Dave spoke one last observation When getting ready lift Jon backboard said occurred one crisis moment hear like mother suddenly able lift car baby Dave expected going superhuman strength
We superhuman strength On Robertss command men raised Jon waist height swiftly seemingly perfectly level though arm deltoid hydraulic Then one motion took downhill negligible help u This cant accurate I remember sensation almost dragged like child sled
A National Geographic television crew embedded Coast Guards air station Sitka filming installment thrillride reality series The network sent crew Coast Guard station around country though assignment appeared hold dramatic potential Air Station Sitka unique Its pilot responsible 12000 mile coastline sprawling treacherous wilderness riven fjord inlet glacier often buffeted implacably horrible weather People went backcountry Alaska way getting different magnitude trouble Roberts put When stuff happens Alaska big Still television crew eighth day Sitka show producer Annabelle Hester explained I call boss headquarters saying Nothing happening We scrambling come Plan B Then Mustangs call came 142
What type injury looking asked dispatcher She taking call behind semicircular counter like reception desk midlevel corporate branch office She framed snapshot parakeet brighten work space photograph dog heart said I Woof You A cameraman stood conspicuously beside holding tense tight shot
Probable broken rib definite broken arm said man end Then voice faltered seemed give And whatever else would happen tree fell added
The dispatcher retrieved appropriate paperwork scribbled Tree fell person one line She read current weather aloud 30 knot wind 300 ceiling heavy rain onemile vi That would soon revised ceiling dropped 100 foot Entering weather condition one Coast Guard incident report someone would write kind nihilistic catchall Extremely terrible
The Coast Guards policy deploy helicopter within 30 minute initial request Air Stations operation officer Cmdr Karl Baldessari informed everyone mission would take longer plan Baldessari 25year veteran Coast Guard fastmoving sinewy man blousy flight suit tidy mustache spiky hair His role air station firehouse chief He responsible safety everyone working meant making judicious decision warranted sending hurtling sky
That calculus got knotty condition like though baseline volatility flying Alaska The Coast Guard didnt let helicopter pilot fly lead Sitka matter much experience air station practiced difficult landing specific location region got ego battered little logging full winter state Visibility Alaska frequently poor condition changed quickly One pilot told blindly tunneling fog dark copilot got caged The man lifted eye momentarily instrument without visual reference horizon latch onto found impossible reorient lost sense direction felled vertigo
During much year also cold enough sufficient moisture air ascending clear region many minor mountain even flying cloud risked aircraft icing To mitigate Coast Guard laid virtual track line across entirety range grid GPS point network path connecting along pilot could chart course fly relatively low altitude confident werent going smash mountain The system wasnt comprehensive track line got pilot close destination ultimately diverge GPS superhighway fly remaining distance oldfashioned way radar eye It like taking exit interstate except might granite wall front wherever chose get It possible pilot would travel far halfmile away whoever needed help discover last leg risky forced turn back
Baldessari gathered two pilot duty afternoon Air Stations flight surgeon unrolled large paper map He pointed location explaining Thats probably one lousiest place fly This Inian Pass right worst place could possibly go
Inian Pass slim channel near center Icy Strait long interconnected system waterway stretching Glacier Bay Conditions Icy Strait bad 300 day year Baldessari recently told wind rain storm surge push fast open ocean But Inian Pass narrow keyhole center strait milewide opening uninhabited island rocky point weather speed The way pilot reach u would fly straight
Nothing National Geographic footage point feel reassuring The flight surgeon hold hand mouth bite lip The copilot Chris Ferguson month posting Alaska mill around fidget ear Its obvious Baldessari need convincing He wasnt eager send men didnt wasnt certain would make way
Its kind funny told pilot pointing map Youve got boat right
Lying backboard like burl driftwood Jon conscious cognizant pain started feel somehow buffered body uninterested connecting world beyond He would later describe thinking blob It passive experience He didnt know happening could tell momentum stalled He confused felt impatient In mind three u solved impossible problem Wed managed get help This supposed simple part everyone rushed hospital Instead condition deteriorated Within 10 minute reaching beach Jon threw Id never seen anything like kind dark purple gristle I took wool cap wipe face retched second time straight hat
I got John Roberts told recently Hed seen vomit like meant Jon ingested fair amount blood signaled internal injury It made Roberts anxious He Mustang two half year point spent previous four year Palm Beach busy le extreme posting often involved rescuing weekend boater relatively close shore Roberts pointed water warm wont necessarily kill go Moreover bulk Coast Guards training maritime rescue rescue land Counterintuitive sound Robertss comfort level confidence dropped significantly hopped Zodiac set foot beach
He reported back Mustang Jon thrown soon radioed explaining Jon going shock He kept giving requesting update trying gauge long might take eventually started erecting makeshift shelter plastic sheeting medical tape hoping keep Jon rain Out earshot u Roberts explained crew mate Eamon McCormack vomit meant The possibility Jon dying care real At one point National Geographic footage Robertss call relayed air station Sitka see dispatcher clearly writes form EMT feel comfortable
By time air station flight surgeon received enough information alarmed It sound like he got pretty significant chest injury told Baldessari Baldessari understood would need launch helicopter warned Mustang aircraft might make weather ultimately would pilot call veered last track line tried shoot Inian Pass
They would go give look Baldessari explained radio outlook iffy The guy beach said must prepared get Jon back cutter haul hospital fast could
One evening winter phone rang Karl Baldessari Long retired Coast Guard teaching aviation community college Oregon I left voice mail message earlier day I meanwhile metamorphosed 40yearold father two fumbled explain Baldessari thrilled I tracked I moment racing finish risotto daughter gymnastics practice would call back Without missing beat Baldessari blared order joking still sounding instinctually charge National Geographic footage OK said want stir constantly slowly
I didnt expect Coast Guardsmen I coldcalling remember day However dramatic remained I assumed would obscured yearslong wash sensational incident But everyone I spoke remember immediately detail Baldessari involved hundred rescue operation 30year career yet I stood stove phone evening told The moment I listened voice mail I knew exactly case It almost like yesterday
There something supreme freakishness accident left lasting impression For came ashore experience also marked feeling subtly escalating chaos pressure surmount McCormack told story retold endlessly often younger Coast Guardsmen eventually tasked training In lesson taking situation look impossible face value said When thing start go wrong dont panic lose sight resource youve got Keep working problem absolute end even McCormack added mean deviating official policy


McCormack supposed landing inflatable boat unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline example But anyway beaching Zodiac gingerly could Roberts men could load Jon aboard They slid side like folder filing cabinet Jon put started motoring chop cautiously back Mustang mile away
As relieved Jon Coast Guard first arrived also felt instantaneously vulnerable Strapped back board neck collar surrendered control body however imperfect control He hauled around object ability wriggle shift position manage pain even turn head see happening He helpless entirely dependent upright people operating around voice could hear discussing far side gauzy divide About 10 minute trip Zodiac Jon heard one voice say Oh shit losing air
A section Zodiacs sponson inflatable fender wrap around boat punctured One side completely deflated Its big deal McCormack recently explained sounding surprised I ask The sponson increase boat buoyancy stability well keeping water cresting side normal condition Zodiac broken sponson would taken service automatically Instead McCormack found puncture wedged nozzle small pump inside Then steering boat one hand operating throttle started working pump foot essentially leg press keep fender partly inflated The ride already bumpy fourfoot sea Now McCormack began tracing slow zigzagging course could tamp turbulence violence Jons spine well guard possibility injured man suddenly bounding side backboard
Roberts Coast Guardsmen Zodiac leaned Jon shield splash The pain heinous Jon seemed passing Roberts talked held hand Roberts felt crushed told torturing guy order save When finally reached Mustang rather hoist Jon Zodiac swung ship crane around simply lifted entire boat water level deck carried aboard keep joggling
McCormack eventually returned Dave halfhour later reunited Jon Mustangs athwartship passageway cramped steel hallway like space two car train Jon still battened backboard wedged keep weight body lesspainful side They cut clothes though hed murmured plea wearing brandnew Patagonia jacket borrowed friend swaddled hypothermia blanket Dave I knelt rubbed foot
The helicopter going make I dont remember grand announcement Im sure ever made aware possibility wouldnt Now crew got busy tying anything could blown rotor wash stashing mess I also dont remember hearing helicopter finally arrived Instead I remember heavy door left swinging open reveal like scene action movie silhouette man blue flight suit foot planted shoulderwidth apart steady ship rocked sideways The cable hed lowered drew back ocean spray fog behind Im flight surgeon Russ Bowman said stepped inside
Bowman took Jons vitals gave several successive shot morphine Soon everyone working squeeze back narrow doorway onto deck helicopter MH60 Jayhawk idling overhead
Until recently story I told accident unfolded two basic act tree fell instantaneously unleashing kind unfathomable chaos Coast Guard appeared swiftly regathered chaos order It like watching footage exploding object watching run reverse The maneuver Coast Guard readying execute deck Mustang would climax progression
The helicopter hovered 30 40 foot boat mirroring speed trajectory vehicle moved slowly forward Looks like youre heading rain squall copilot Chris Ferguson radioed Mustang one point asked ship adjust course keep forgiving weather possible Soon flight mechanic calling instruction tuck aircraft alignment Forward right 30 Forward right 20 Forward right 10 Then finally speaking flight recording almost galling air imperturbability lead helicopter pilot Rich McIntyre radioed flight mechanic begin hoist
The whole procedure vantage point seemed seamless routine In way After agonized deliberation air station pilot exited GPS route fairly manageable condition around Inian Pass The wind workable water wasnt excessively choppy Ultimately scooping Jon deck Mustang would resemble standard exercise pilot drilled training Not dumb copilot Chris Ferguson told plucking someone spinal injury moving boat hoisting moving helicopter pretty insane thing But normalize isnt normal
A moment earlier men scurried around Jon backboard packaging fastening hoist Jon worried second got airborne would start twirling uncontrollably like feathery end cat toy potentially thwack head equipment deck But levitating smoothly solitary swaddled bale man perfectly perpendicular ground Dave I watched happen friend rising steadily away u improbably safety As Jon floated higher could hear Coast Guardsmen Mustang beneath begin cheer He felt safe open eye When saw someone hunched open cargo door helicopter pointing television camera
Jon rushed surgery hospital Sitka evening Hed punctured lung one point collapse sustained multiple fracture eight rib broken several vertebra shattered left shoulder blade snapped brachial plexus nerve His spleen macerated countless fleck After awakening surgery Jon disappointed doctor swept shard bag thrown spleen trash wanted get look maybe even keep preserved jar alongside cyborgbanana
Once back Gustavus Dave I realized would need call Jons parent Switzerland I didnt push job Dave time adamant He felt would need face conversation like going doctor It Jons father picked absorbing news paused caught Dave guard Thank said solemnly You guy saved son life
Daves stomach dropped I remember thinking told recently realizing Yeah I guess logistically I reaction Dave hung phone clearly shaken relayed conversation Until moment idea saved Jons life never occurred u possibly idea Jon might died still hadnt occurred u We zero sense accomplishment even agency In mind avoid screwing real help could arrive save
But Jon hadnt absorbed story way From instant willed water felt u locking seamless flow order steadily displacing chaos Dave I experienced Coast Guard arrived It amazing three u managed generate solution successive problem Even reciting poem always felt like moment utter helplessness became Jons telling perfect emblem streak serendipitous problemsolving You conveyed calmness told recently I remember nice moment He added ever spend two hour dying remote forest floor recite poetry would one top way
The feeling inevitability day became pronounced Jon time passed entire story rescue receded prologue rest life The surgery Sitka first half dozen would take several year regain 60 percent use arm wrist hand nerve gradually regrew along injured side He good enough shape go back Alaska summer accident repairing boat company warehouse occasionally helping bedandbreakfast struggled He could repair kayak needed help lifting He unable wrestle mattress corner fitted sheet made bed After started working recording studio Portland envisioned stuck water run audiomastering company Spleenless Mastering
Eventually Jon seemed recovered accident without conspicuous disability But life quietly corroded chronic pain almost equally stress navigating doctor medication side effect manage About two year accident learned PTSD The trauma wasnt falling tree experience powerlessness perpetual patient American medical system It manifested kind unbearable empathy anyone suffering Jon found shouting doctor behalf also behalf stranger waiting room werent seen He would hear interview naturaldisaster victim homeless NPR pull car There continued tribulation mundane one A time year still rebreaks rib nowhere twice Jon told taken especially affectionate hug wife
Jon found early could cordon suffering mind conversation making joke accident sticking happy ending rescue trick got much easier National Geographic show aired later year Mission Rescue Final Frontier program called The soundtrack heartthwacking synth drum shredding guitar A foreboding Ken Burnseffected snapshot Dave Jon looking joyful trip gave way whirring reenactment someone el leg cast role Daves leg sprinting blurry wood radio A melodramatic narrator pondered fate Kayaker Jon Cohrs
Initially schlockiness production felt like blessing The show depersonalized accident giving u shorthand convey dramatic day without confronting destabilizing senseless might felt At party could lay basic tree fell Jon say National Geographic even made TV special everyone would go wideeyed move figuring would unspool real story time
But never realized degree kitschy shorthand started obscure real story gradually replace Im embarrassed admit though Jon I remained close I know extent continued suffer last 17 year talking several hour order write account
The morning accident Dave I traveled back Dundas Bay pack campsite collect kayak abandoned previous evening We shuttled Gustavus boat captain dropped u three day earlier forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy
The tide cove way arrived Ogilvy put suckass beach The approach shallow drop anchor hundred yard shore He asked wader We So Ogilvy put climbed ladder told Dave get back Then stoically like ox oldtimey strongman hauling safe trudged thighhigh water dropped Dave gravel beach lurched back hauled way I mansize infant papoose
Dave told hed strange feeling ride would discover even massive tree fallen tent since last slept three u would crushed killed wed spent another night Dundas Bay planned That halfexpected find evidence accident fortuitous somehow reason redemptive value behind My mother instinct I called night On phone I strained emphasize two year cruelly premature widowhood I new overprotective son widow Jon going right Dave I safe She told dad must looking u somehow
I resented supernatural thinking If comforted people fine Id somehow known right away I didnt need reason accident It senseless straightforward unequivocal fact father death A tree fell wood It might Jon could died didnt Other possibility spiraled infinitely outward though apparently I wasnt interested contemplating As strange sound year I realized tree could hit friend pointed I told story around fire one night And week ago phone Jon occurred tree could hit three u standing singlefile line waiting cross creek might wound clobbered scattered river dying slowly watching die
Its also probably true I helped preclude possibility feverishly paranoid bear wheeling around sound snapping root Thats allowed see tree coming barely scream infinitesimal headsup Dave And real meaning accident I felt compelled find one might validated exaggerated fear But instead somehow helped cleanse There comfort accepting arbitrariness happened regarding spasm random damage time space randomly small number human being got opportunity repair We capable I understood We also far helpless
On ride back Gustavus gear I pictured small blip empty space The ride rough jumpy Ogilvy impatiently pounded boat last vestigial wave energy storm Dave I hold plant bench behind But moment I felt safe I loosened grip leaned slightly motion boat closing eye felt lift seat

DAVID BENJAMIN SHERRY
The whale sighting happened right away minute Day 1 Jon Dave I dropped remote Alaskan shoreline hour half boat closest speck town Jon working seakayaking guide summer Glacier Bay National Park invited u sevenday excursion week As boat delivered u vanished drone engine dampening murmur finally trailing became unthinkably quiet beach largeness strangeness surroundings suddenly apparent It familiar phenomenon Jon start trip moment people instinctually paused soak To felt like scene astronaut finally rattled free earth atmosphere slip stillness space Except werent space We earth finally really earth
We starting move around packing gear kayak heard first huff blowhole far offshore
Jon ecstatic It seemed animal putting show swimming playfully kelp diving resurfacing plowing open mouth across surface feed He took good omen Though I idea time anxious Dave I might feel intimidated making trip big payoff quickly would get u excited defuse apprehension
For Dave whalesighting exactly opposite effect Once kid dad took scuba diving dolphin They friendly aweinspiring creature purportedly terrified Dave instead He could still conjure feeling hanging defenselessly water animal deftly swirled around le like solid object flash reflected light could move comparative slowmotion Ever since harbored fear large sea creature niche phobia particularly young man lived Bronx genuine one still And even Dave understood chance see whale close like major draw kayaking trip Alaska though feigned thrilled second thought kicking We going realized
The whale left exhilarated gleeful like Jon deeper I also remember feeling shaken like Dave Nothing animal registered playful welcoming It appeared distance transited quickly past u left right My uneasiness something whale great size indifference obliviousness passed Watching made feel profoundly place register large wilderness relative
At time I working literary magazine New York City called The Hudson Review picking poem slush pile mailing outside panel editorial adviser I trying hard letter impress one Hayden Carruth gruff irreverent 81yearold poet lived far upstate I loved Carruths work enamored persona yeoman life wood intolerance phoniness precision articulated common suffering including one strain suffering I related particularly year wouldnt courage clarity examine
I always aware Carruth wrote youth Universe sad everything animate inanimate wild creature stone star enveloped great sadness pervaded Never I able look cloudless sky night see beauty A kind grandeur yes beauty The profusion variety celestial light always frightened Why Why instead others Why instead nothing
That I felt watching whale beach afraid everything accident Then maybe hard picture start trip retrospect without amplifying feeling foreboding Something else Carruth wrote always stuck The wilderness begin edge body edge consciousness extends edge universe filled menace
Read Aleksander Doba 71yearold kayaked across Atlantic 3 time
It midAugust 2002 23 24 25 We graduated college together two year earlier Dave I also grew shot undergrad knowing wanted doctor finished first year medical school Any similar momentum I graduation instantly sapped Three night I returned parent house school I found driving father emergency room Three week died My grief disorienting total moment life everything supposed feel possible making single decision became impossible I gave sadness better part year resettling home New Jersey widowed mother sliding back summer job I worked school glumly breaking beef butcher shop two town
I coped fatherlessness confusion way Im proud still dont understand I read lot book Ronald Reagan example even collection love letter Nancy I also lashed Dave living home summer studying MCAT He withdrew awkwardly funeral I suppose I happy hold It triggered longstanding jealousy A part always resented seemed unfairly exempt selfdoubt heaviness I prone
Jon meanwhile teaching rustic little boarding school Switzerland mother The summer graduation starting job set Alaska friend sleeping bed old pickup In minuscule town Gustavus gateway Glacier Bay picked seasonal work warehouse kayaktour company Jon little actual experience sea kayaking always felt drawn ocean abstract In college another friend plotted paddling expedition near Glacier Bay across border Canada applied grant school fund The grant set memory alumnus died avalanche mountaineering It meant encourage responsible conscientious pursuit wilderness expedition Safety key But committee rejected Jon partner application They seemed insufficiently prepared
That wasnt surprising Jon grew lot backcountry camping competent outdoorsman putting together grant application required kind administrative fastidiousness didnt always posse He bright scatterbrained forever picking thing putting figuratively music project conversation also literally I still picture hustling around house shared college hunting key soldering iron gotten head rewiring device He artist one piece I remember consisted halfpeeled banana implanted circuitry suspended jar formaldehyde Once grew grass upstairs bathroom living bathmat said turf became muddy flooded downstairs
This Jons third summer Alaska hed worked way leading expedition taking vacationer day time Our trip however would venture beyond typical circuit remote corner park hed never Jon serious concern safety felt bore responsibility emotional wellbeing To enjoy would need feel comfortable wilderness also leader
He suspected wouldnt trust entirely We didnt We knew became professional guide perception expertise lagged behind reality With Jon Dave told always unclear extent hed thought everything Dave remembered landing Gustavus night got underway casually asking Jon lot question Where going exactly Do everything need Jon seemed solid answer As headed back place good night sleep told u wait yard He living alone summer house acquaintance building wood The structure framedup largely wallless Jon safe needed check moose wandered
After spectacular first day paddling came ashore rocky tidal flat two mile dropped Jon gave u detailed tutorial bear safety set campsite He taught u example holler Hey bear heard rustling also preventively ahead u walked wood The last thing wanted come across brown bear unannounced
Hey bear Jon kept hollering way demonstration He said goofily like childrens TV host greeting downonhisluck ursine neighbor doorway clubhouse This intentional Jon noticed people trip often resisted bellowing Hey bear wilderness It essential safety felt silly vulnerable somehow like singing public So learned turn shtick spinning streamofconsciousness narration Hey bear Im coming tree Hope youre fantastic evening Mr Bear It loosened everyone They performing friend whole group joke
I never seen wild bear though I backpacked bear country handful time I felt comfortable animal abstract But bear werent abstract breached material plane There bear trail everywhere leading tree line water disquietingly close I felt pitching tent We found heap scat We saw tree animal slashed bark eat inner layer tuft fur paw still plastered sap
I pretended I fun But evening I grew increasingly petrified almost delirious My eye tightened scanning bear The sound wind became bear mossy stick cracking foot I gave migraine phased sleep
At sunrise I woke feeling foolish While Jon cooked pancake I reasoned privately notebook I brought trip I tried conceive situation geometry problem Yes number bear roved landscape I wrote relatively tiny independent blip going business randomly like u In empty space confusion lethal collision moving blip moving blip would improbable coincidence Id distorting odds mistaking absolute focus bear attention I wrote It embarrassing really To afraid bear I concluded narcissistic
I reminding freakishly horrible thing definition unlikely happen Even reasoning feel sound
Read search missing hiker Joshua Trees wild interior
Day 2 slog We paddled spitting drizzle endless straight line along high granite wall coast We talked le le pushed emerald chop Then eventually gave hauling boat making camp wide crescentshaped cove short site Jon originally picked map
We entered Dundas Bay rarely visited pocket national park Ive since learned storied history hideout solitary misanthrope In 1930s one prospector built cabin far campsite brandished gun Alaska Natives passed
We intuited scenery beautiful could see little fog Our guidebook explained east side bay get extremely rough foul weather since large wave roll batter shoreline That happening The weather plinked u afternoon roiling storm Soon big rain started We rushed dinner loafed tent eventually loafing turned sleep
A local newspaper would later describe storm short intense In Gustavus creek swelled foot higher previous record Gale wind gust 59 mile per hour turned back two cruise ship Skagway 85 mile north Around 2 woke discover wind shorn rain fly tent Jons sleeping bag mine soaked Dave snug dry u We heard torrent water lashing wave crashing cove
We got three four hour later The rain wind longer felt ferocious still gnarly paddle question Jon said staying put We cooked breakfast took turn playing chess tent By late morning storm seemed passed We antsy We figured would take look around
The terrain crammed thicket alder spruce underlain fern furor prickly thing Jon pointed devil club three four foot tall leafy armored spine The plant pierced fleece hurt like fire
There trail Wed trudging time reached fastmoving stream maybe 10 foot wide Jon surprised wasnt map likely drainage bloated storm We followed downstream looking way across eventually found bridged hefty tree trunk It seemed like easy crossing Jon stepped led way Dave I waited singlefile line stream bank behind The creek loud like factory gear roller churning Looking Jon realized water hed thought
Thats I heard snap wood behind After paranoia I instantly understood many bear Id thought I heard absolutely bear nothing sound unmistakable crisp explicitly something I turned hollered Hey bear waited beat Maybe I said Hey bear Im sure But I must scanned tree long enough feel satisfied safe I know I turning head go back friend I saw dark shape rushing forward peripheral vision
What I heard must root popping If tree large enough apparently hear cracking underground like gunfire
The thud seismic The trunk crashed right next Mapping bit evidence later concluded tree must 80 foot tall perhaps two foot diameter It kind conifer spruce cedar I screamed involuntarily Look watched Dave step directly front dive sideways hit ground When I got crouching stunned OK He looked said Go get Jon
It hadnt clicked back There three u The sight Dave going canceled everything else I scrambled creek running across tree fallen shouting Jons name spotted water tangled snarl shearedoff branch near bank behind cage kept hurtling downstream
He know hed hit falling tree It narrowly missed head struck left shoulder shearing collarbone breaking many rib Later doctor would explain downward force powerful probably squashed Jons entire upper body organ inside toward waist momentarily compressing like bellow split second shoulder headed direction bellybutton torso sprang
Jon heard nothing seen nothing He turning around help Dave onto log feeling responsible safety next thing knew water He tried reach left arm could make move He could move leg He felt bolt pain spine
Jon later described flashing idiosyncratic sequence thought millisecond watching deck card fanning across table One image wheelchair sitting behind mixing console fancy recording studio I guess I become recording engineer wheelchair remembered thinking He never worked recording studio though played music particular plan Still vision apparently felt like acceptable future freed resurface present That registered screaming name
Jon told shouldnt move He knew many wilderness firstresponder training moving person spinal injury risk paralysis Then also knew body submerged cold water recognized risked dying hypothermia didnt move If Im already paralyzed concluded I may well move
He somehow hoisted stream Dave I got using right arm chin biting something loamy teeth additional leverage He reassessed situation better Also worse He realized least mile inland camp
Suddenly body walking leg started working Dave I put u supporting frame He moving faster expected uncoordinatedly Then crumpled u We tried Jon dead weight Dave noticed breathing shallow voice low sign Dave knew med school collapsed lung He began battering Jon pep talk telling firmly get get Jon didnt need explained cogent still trying plot next step mind He looked see log resting lumpy realized fact sitting left arm The arm slack obviously broken sleeve pierced devil club Jon zero feeling He found amusing sensation complete estrangement one limb
Jon stressing important stay together But another theory wilderness survival appeared breaking practice Someone would get radio back camp By chance marooned tent rainstorm night Jon showed u use device though almost formality handheld VHF unit merely lineofsight radio told u meaning range small signal weak pas obstacle You unlikely reach anyone couldnt see hadnt seen anyone since faraway fishing boat early Day 1
There moment discussion maybe exchange look Dave I told Dave go I didnt trust find way back I also knew I lacked courage try whether I sensible cowardly I still dont know Besides I took granted Dave would make He capable mind le likely cinch indecisive knot
Recently though Dave told You probably idea much head I I know growing definitely felt insecure thing I think looked thought Dave everything figured But I much anxiety He brought tremor used hand I knew high school waited table together I occasionally carry Daves soup order wouldnt spill But I guess I thought tremor strictly physiological I couldnt see vulnerability causing
Now Dave sprinted away Jon swatting devil club path rubberized sleeve rain jacket nerve rose rattled He worried wouldnt able find radio got back know turn What broke radio foreclosing whatever marginal chance getting help There lot way screw Dave realized More occurred ran
He found radio He turned Then solved problem encountered another hadnt anticipated What appropriate thing youre supposed say remembered thinking On TV see lot people saying Mayday And Dave faced open water started broadcasting fog Mayday Mayday Even moment though alone beach middle nowhere felt slightly selfconscious This goddamn cliché thought
Back wood kneeling Jon I problem I didnt know say He lying near log injured side beard glass flecked dirt tendril moss He seemed brink losing consciousness At time would possibility Jons dying surface concretely mind Still I knew I supposed keep talking tether world voice somehow
I started vamping platitude We going get soon forth But I could feel treading water even blundering one point longwinded apology worried I overstayed welcome one Christmas family I afraid helplessness voice might counterproductive unsettling Jon instead steadying It tremendous silence fill
What person say I two literature professor college made u memorize poem You never knew line verse would come handy claimed One liked brag traveling Ireland found spat Yeats pub could drink free This I wound reciting love poem Jon
It The Shampoo Elizabeth Bishop lyric poem enormity time turn startlingly intimate end Bishop offer shampoo lover silvering hair Come let wash big tin basinbattered shiny like moon
After I imagine I also WH Auden I knew fair amount Auden back The stuff rhyme meter always easiest memorize Looking star I know quite wellThat care I go hell I lot Robert Frost disposal well Stopping Woods Snowy Evening The Road Not Taken For part I trafficked hit
Jon I would spend hour half together alone forest floor I ran everything quiver Kay Ryan AR Ammons Michael Donaghy padding poem little prefatory remark Jon said nothing signaled eye produced sound whenever I checked I felt like radio DJ playing record middle night unsure anyone listening And here one owl Richard Wilbur I would tell Jon would go
I must also done least one Hayden Carruth curmudgeonly pen pal literary magazine Carruths poem didnt lend memorization Id worked hard nail one favorite describes stopping notice deer standing apple thicket realizing northern light flaring overhead Hayden animal pas moment stillness together We proud afraid writes proud sharethe silent magnetic storm destroys star Relative boundless violence deer momentarily allied though still entirely connected glimpse acknowledgmentit enough never enough
Thats I said friend powerlessly tenting jacket face started rain The title poem I Know I Remember But How Can I Help You
The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasnt supposed The 110foot patrol boat normally spent time coursing Gulf Alaska inspecting halibutfishing vessel circulating terrorist deterrent near oil terminal Valdez It homeported Seward hundred mile Glacier Bay But crew transiting Juneau training day earlier smacked storm later poured inland u We gotten absolutely pummeled John Roberts petty officer Mustang told recently For two day boat swished around 15footplus sea Many crew hunkered mess deck vomiting Roberts couple shipmate best cover everyones watch Finally Mustang slipped Glacier Bay find protection The weather started ease That afternoon Roberts piloted Mustang east toward Dundas Bay pallid crewmates finally staggering back bridge asking hell
That Daves Mayday call came The signal Mustangs radio thin faint barely edging range Another ship petty officer Eamon McCormack explained retrospect connection feel mindboggling Glacier Bay National Park extends 5000 square mile Our signal would covered two three mile And yet boat Coast Guard boat le happened passing exceedingly small window precisely right time I dont know nine time 10 play outcome would McCormack said A moment earlier later second potentially might slipped alignment The moving boat would cruised range uncoupling u forever


It 125 pm Mustang received Daves call according one subsequent Coast Guard report Roberts couldnt believe Come man Im tired said aloud wearily receiver front Roberts waited moment per protocol chance Coast Guards central communication center Juneau would pick call instead Then turned asked watch commander pull standardized searchandrescue paperwork He steeling resummoning professionalism I guess said
Roberts crew member Mustang current medical training would complete EMT certification following month As started firing question Dave radio didnt like answer heard coming back shallowness Jons breathing likelihood punctured lung More fundamental Roberts remembered Any time tree fall somebody good He also unsettled learn Dave I lived New York City red flag found someone wind trouble wilderness
We 100 nautical mile nearest hospital halfday trip even ideal condition The Mustang requested Coast Guard Air Station Sitka send helicopter immediate plan Roberts three crewmates peel toward shore ship Zodiac track u Dave found flare Jons emergency kit 220 Zodiac underway Coast Guard asked fire He still front campsite facing water Hed never shot flare He aimed straight watched bright tracer rose arced somewhere far behind deep wood He uncertain whether counted success He started scanning fog front Zodiac never appeared
Someone Mustang caught sight flare near end arc immediately directed crew Zodiac toward steering far away Dave opposite side little peninsula wed camped And yet lucky wound coming ashore much closer I waiting wood Jon Soon whatever poem I reciting interrupted whistle blowing voice calling eventually three shape wearing hard hat heavy orange rain gear rushed toward u tree
Roberts especially impressive reassuringly large Bostonarea native booming voice He knelt took Jons vitals The information troubling pulse 60 beat per minute breathing fast shallow They put neck brace eased onto kind truncated backboard called Miller board move beach Dave returned He I crouched one end board near Jons foot someone presumably Roberts bellowed count three lift
Later night lying sleep bedandbreakfast Gustavus stunned depleted dry warm Dave I would talk talk reviewing entire ordeal We drooped long silence coasting toward sleep Dave spoke one last observation When getting ready lift Jon backboard said occurred one crisis moment hear like mother suddenly able lift car baby Dave expected going superhuman strength
We superhuman strength On Robertss command men raised Jon waist height swiftly seemingly perfectly level though arm deltoid hydraulic Then one motion took downhill negligible help u This cant accurate I remember sensation almost dragged like child sled
A National Geographic television crew embedded Coast Guards air station Sitka filming installment thrillride reality series The network sent crew Coast Guard station around country though assignment appeared hold dramatic potential Air Station Sitka unique Its pilot responsible 12000 mile coastline sprawling treacherous wilderness riven fjord inlet glacier often buffeted implacably horrible weather People went backcountry Alaska way getting different magnitude trouble Roberts put When stuff happens Alaska big Still television crew eighth day Sitka show producer Annabelle Hester explained I call boss headquarters saying Nothing happening We scrambling come Plan B Then Mustangs call came 142
What type injury looking asked dispatcher She taking call behind semicircular counter like reception desk midlevel corporate branch office She framed snapshot parakeet brighten work space photograph dog heart said I Woof You A cameraman stood conspicuously beside holding tense tight shot
Probable broken rib definite broken arm said man end Then voice faltered seemed give And whatever else would happen tree fell added
The dispatcher retrieved appropriate paperwork scribbled Tree fell person one line She read current weather aloud 30 knot wind 300 ceiling heavy rain onemile vi That would soon revised ceiling dropped 100 foot Entering weather condition one Coast Guard incident report someone would write kind nihilistic catchall Extremely terrible
The Coast Guards policy deploy helicopter within 30 minute initial request Air Stations operation officer Cmdr Karl Baldessari informed everyone mission would take longer plan Baldessari 25year veteran Coast Guard fastmoving sinewy man blousy flight suit tidy mustache spiky hair His role air station firehouse chief He responsible safety everyone working meant making judicious decision warranted sending hurtling sky
That calculus got knotty condition like though baseline volatility flying Alaska The Coast Guard didnt let helicopter pilot fly lead Sitka matter much experience air station practiced difficult landing specific location region got ego battered little logging full winter state Visibility Alaska frequently poor condition changed quickly One pilot told blindly tunneling fog dark copilot got caged The man lifted eye momentarily instrument without visual reference horizon latch onto found impossible reorient lost sense direction felled vertigo
During much year also cold enough sufficient moisture air ascending clear region many minor mountain even flying cloud risked aircraft icing To mitigate Coast Guard laid virtual track line across entirety range grid GPS point network path connecting along pilot could chart course fly relatively low altitude confident werent going smash mountain The system wasnt comprehensive track line got pilot close destination ultimately diverge GPS superhighway fly remaining distance oldfashioned way radar eye It like taking exit interstate except might granite wall front wherever chose get It possible pilot would travel far halfmile away whoever needed help discover last leg risky forced turn back
Baldessari gathered two pilot duty afternoon Air Stations flight surgeon unrolled large paper map He pointed location explaining Thats probably one lousiest place fly This Inian Pass right worst place could possibly go
Inian Pass slim channel near center Icy Strait long interconnected system waterway stretching Glacier Bay Conditions Icy Strait bad 300 day year Baldessari recently told wind rain storm surge push fast open ocean But Inian Pass narrow keyhole center strait milewide opening uninhabited island rocky point weather speed The way pilot reach u would fly straight
Nothing National Geographic footage point feel reassuring The flight surgeon hold hand mouth bite lip The copilot Chris Ferguson month posting Alaska mill around fidget ear Its obvious Baldessari need convincing He wasnt eager send men didnt wasnt certain would make way
Its kind funny told pilot pointing map Youve got boat right
Lying backboard like burl driftwood Jon conscious cognizant pain started feel somehow buffered body uninterested connecting world beyond He would later describe thinking blob It passive experience He didnt know happening could tell momentum stalled He confused felt impatient In mind three u solved impossible problem Wed managed get help This supposed simple part everyone rushed hospital Instead condition deteriorated Within 10 minute reaching beach Jon threw Id never seen anything like kind dark purple gristle I took wool cap wipe face retched second time straight hat
I got John Roberts told recently Hed seen vomit like meant Jon ingested fair amount blood signaled internal injury It made Roberts anxious He Mustang two half year point spent previous four year Palm Beach busy le extreme posting often involved rescuing weekend boater relatively close shore Roberts pointed water warm wont necessarily kill go Moreover bulk Coast Guards training maritime rescue rescue land Counterintuitive sound Robertss comfort level confidence dropped significantly hopped Zodiac set foot beach
He reported back Mustang Jon thrown soon radioed explaining Jon going shock He kept giving requesting update trying gauge long might take eventually started erecting makeshift shelter plastic sheeting medical tape hoping keep Jon rain Out earshot u Roberts explained crew mate Eamon McCormack vomit meant The possibility Jon dying care real At one point National Geographic footage Robertss call relayed air station Sitka see dispatcher clearly writes form EMT feel comfortable
By time air station flight surgeon received enough information alarmed It sound like he got pretty significant chest injury told Baldessari Baldessari understood would need launch helicopter warned Mustang aircraft might make weather ultimately would pilot call veered last track line tried shoot Inian Pass
They would go give look Baldessari explained radio outlook iffy The guy beach said must prepared get Jon back cutter haul hospital fast could
One evening winter phone rang Karl Baldessari Long retired Coast Guard teaching aviation community college Oregon I left voice mail message earlier day I meanwhile metamorphosed 40yearold father two fumbled explain Baldessari thrilled I tracked I moment racing finish risotto daughter gymnastics practice would call back Without missing beat Baldessari blared order joking still sounding instinctually charge National Geographic footage OK said want stir constantly slowly
I didnt expect Coast Guardsmen I coldcalling remember day However dramatic remained I assumed would obscured yearslong wash sensational incident But everyone I spoke remember immediately detail Baldessari involved hundred rescue operation 30year career yet I stood stove phone evening told The moment I listened voice mail I knew exactly case It almost like yesterday
There something supreme freakishness accident left lasting impression For came ashore experience also marked feeling subtly escalating chaos pressure surmount McCormack told story retold endlessly often younger Coast Guardsmen eventually tasked training In lesson taking situation look impossible face value said When thing start go wrong dont panic lose sight resource youve got Keep working problem absolute end even McCormack added mean deviating official policy


McCormack supposed landing inflatable boat unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline example But anyway beaching Zodiac gingerly could Roberts men could load Jon aboard They slid side like folder filing cabinet Jon put started motoring chop cautiously back Mustang mile away
As relieved Jon Coast Guard first arrived also felt instantaneously vulnerable Strapped back board neck collar surrendered control body however imperfect control He hauled around object ability wriggle shift position manage pain even turn head see happening He helpless entirely dependent upright people operating around voice could hear discussing far side gauzy divide About 10 minute trip Zodiac Jon heard one voice say Oh shit losing air
A section Zodiacs sponson inflatable fender wrap around boat punctured One side completely deflated Its big deal McCormack recently explained sounding surprised I ask The sponson increase boat buoyancy stability well keeping water cresting side normal condition Zodiac broken sponson would taken service automatically Instead McCormack found puncture wedged nozzle small pump inside Then steering boat one hand operating throttle started working pump foot essentially leg press keep fender partly inflated The ride already bumpy fourfoot sea Now McCormack began tracing slow zigzagging course could tamp turbulence violence Jons spine well guard possibility injured man suddenly bounding side backboard
Roberts Coast Guardsmen Zodiac leaned Jon shield splash The pain heinous Jon seemed passing Roberts talked held hand Roberts felt crushed told torturing guy order save When finally reached Mustang rather hoist Jon Zodiac swung ship crane around simply lifted entire boat water level deck carried aboard keep joggling
McCormack eventually returned Dave halfhour later reunited Jon Mustangs athwartship passageway cramped steel hallway like space two car train Jon still battened backboard wedged keep weight body lesspainful side They cut clothes though hed murmured plea wearing brandnew Patagonia jacket borrowed friend swaddled hypothermia blanket Dave I knelt rubbed foot
The helicopter going make I dont remember grand announcement Im sure ever made aware possibility wouldnt Now crew got busy tying anything could blown rotor wash stashing mess I also dont remember hearing helicopter finally arrived Instead I remember heavy door left swinging open reveal like scene action movie silhouette man blue flight suit foot planted shoulderwidth apart steady ship rocked sideways The cable hed lowered drew back ocean spray fog behind Im flight surgeon Russ Bowman said stepped inside
Bowman took Jons vitals gave several successive shot morphine Soon everyone working squeeze back narrow doorway onto deck helicopter MH60 Jayhawk idling overhead
Until recently story I told accident unfolded two basic act tree fell instantaneously unleashing kind unfathomable chaos Coast Guard appeared swiftly regathered chaos order It like watching footage exploding object watching run reverse The maneuver Coast Guard readying execute deck Mustang would climax progression
The helicopter hovered 30 40 foot boat mirroring speed trajectory vehicle moved slowly forward Looks like youre heading rain squall copilot Chris Ferguson radioed Mustang one point asked ship adjust course keep forgiving weather possible Soon flight mechanic calling instruction tuck aircraft alignment Forward right 30 Forward right 20 Forward right 10 Then finally speaking flight recording almost galling air imperturbability lead helicopter pilot Rich McIntyre radioed flight mechanic begin hoist
The whole procedure vantage point seemed seamless routine In way After agonized deliberation air station pilot exited GPS route fairly manageable condition around Inian Pass The wind workable water wasnt excessively choppy Ultimately scooping Jon deck Mustang would resemble standard exercise pilot drilled training Not dumb copilot Chris Ferguson told plucking someone spinal injury moving boat hoisting moving helicopter pretty insane thing But normalize isnt normal
A moment earlier men scurried around Jon backboard packaging fastening hoist Jon worried second got airborne would start twirling uncontrollably like feathery end cat toy potentially thwack head equipment deck But levitating smoothly solitary swaddled bale man perfectly perpendicular ground Dave I watched happen friend rising steadily away u improbably safety As Jon floated higher could hear Coast Guardsmen Mustang beneath begin cheer He felt safe open eye When saw someone hunched open cargo door helicopter pointing television camera
Jon rushed surgery hospital Sitka evening Hed punctured lung one point collapse sustained multiple fracture eight rib broken several vertebra shattered left shoulder blade snapped brachial plexus nerve His spleen macerated countless fleck After awakening surgery Jon disappointed doctor swept shard bag thrown spleen trash wanted get look maybe even keep preserved jar alongside cyborgbanana
Once back Gustavus Dave I realized would need call Jons parent Switzerland I didnt push job Dave time adamant He felt would need face conversation like going doctor It Jons father picked absorbing news paused caught Dave guard Thank said solemnly You guy saved son life
Daves stomach dropped I remember thinking told recently realizing Yeah I guess logistically I reaction Dave hung phone clearly shaken relayed conversation Until moment idea saved Jons life never occurred u possibly idea Jon might died still hadnt occurred u We zero sense accomplishment even agency In mind avoid screwing real help could arrive save
But Jon hadnt absorbed story way From instant willed water felt u locking seamless flow order steadily displacing chaos Dave I experienced Coast Guard arrived It amazing three u managed generate solution successive problem Even reciting poem always felt like moment utter helplessness became Jons telling perfect emblem streak serendipitous problemsolving You conveyed calmness told recently I remember nice moment He added ever spend two hour dying remote forest floor recite poetry would one top way
The feeling inevitability day became pronounced Jon time passed entire story rescue receded prologue rest life The surgery Sitka first half dozen would take several year regain 60 percent use arm wrist hand nerve gradually regrew along injured side He good enough shape go back Alaska summer accident repairing boat company warehouse occasionally helping bedandbreakfast struggled He could repair kayak needed help lifting He unable wrestle mattress corner fitted sheet made bed After started working recording studio Portland envisioned stuck water run audiomastering company Spleenless Mastering
Eventually Jon seemed recovered accident without conspicuous disability But life quietly corroded chronic pain almost equally stress navigating doctor medication side effect manage About two year accident learned PTSD The trauma wasnt falling tree experience powerlessness perpetual patient American medical system It manifested kind unbearable empathy anyone suffering Jon found shouting doctor behalf also behalf stranger waiting room werent seen He would hear interview naturaldisaster victim homeless NPR pull car There continued tribulation mundane one A time year still rebreaks rib nowhere twice Jon told taken especially affectionate hug wife
Jon found early could cordon suffering mind conversation making joke accident sticking happy ending rescue trick got much easier National Geographic show aired later year Mission Rescue Final Frontier program called The soundtrack heartthwacking synth drum shredding guitar A foreboding Ken Burnseffected snapshot Dave Jon looking joyful trip gave way whirring reenactment someone el leg cast role Daves leg sprinting blurry wood radio A melodramatic narrator pondered fate Kayaker Jon Cohrs
Initially schlockiness production felt like blessing The show depersonalized accident giving u shorthand convey dramatic day without confronting destabilizing senseless might felt At party could lay basic tree fell Jon say National Geographic even made TV special everyone would go wideeyed move figuring would unspool real story time
But never realized degree kitschy shorthand started obscure real story gradually replace Im embarrassed admit though Jon I remained close I know extent continued suffer last 17 year talking several hour order write account
The morning accident Dave I traveled back Dundas Bay pack campsite collect kayak abandoned previous evening We shuttled Gustavus boat captain dropped u three day earlier forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy
The tide cove way arrived Ogilvy put suckass beach The approach shallow drop anchor hundred yard shore He asked wader We So Ogilvy put climbed ladder told Dave get back Then stoically like ox oldtimey strongman hauling safe trudged thighhigh water dropped Dave gravel beach lurched back hauled way I mansize infant papoose
Dave told hed strange feeling ride would discover even massive tree fallen tent since last slept three u would crushed killed wed spent another night Dundas Bay planned That halfexpected find evidence accident fortuitous somehow reason redemptive value behind My mother instinct I called night On phone I strained emphasize two year cruelly premature widowhood I new overprotective son widow Jon going right Dave I safe She told dad must looking u somehow
I resented supernatural thinking If comforted people fine Id somehow known right away I didnt need reason accident It senseless straightforward unequivocal fact father death A tree fell wood It might Jon could died didnt Other possibility spiraled infinitely outward though apparently I wasnt interested contemplating As strange sound year I realized tree could hit friend pointed I told story around fire one night And week ago phone Jon occurred tree could hit three u standing singlefile line waiting cross creek might wound clobbered scattered river dying slowly watching die
Its also probably true I helped preclude possibility feverishly paranoid bear wheeling around sound snapping root Thats allowed see tree coming barely scream infinitesimal headsup Dave And real meaning accident I felt compelled find one might validated exaggerated fear But instead somehow helped cleanse There comfort accepting arbitrariness happened regarding spasm random damage time space randomly small number human being got opportunity repair We capable I understood We also far helpless
On ride back Gustavus gear I pictured small blip empty space The ride rough jumpy Ogilvy impatiently pounded boat last vestigial wave energy storm Dave I hold plant bench behind But moment I felt safe I loosened grip leaned slightly motion boat closing eye felt lift seat

Read profile Terry Gross host Fresh Air
Eventually Stevess busy New York day ended Upper East Side scheduled give talk Barnes Noble As drove event Steves confessed wasnt sure kind crowd would get You never knew exactly Rickniks hardcore fan call would materialize en masse Some Steves appearance mobbed others sparse His appeal slightly cultish For every Ricknik world large contingent average people idea
I mildly skeptical Stevess drawing power New York It hard imagine bunch cynical worldly urban polyglot multicultural East Coast sophisticate people probably vacationed deconsecrated ecohostels Oman Madagascar getting excited public television reigning expert Europe
We arrived however find bookstore overflowing A solid wave applause met Steves door Fans pouring organizer told u two solid hour People sat aisle stood back Some wore Tshirts hat bearing Rick Steves slogan Keep Travelin The crowd body heat overwhelmed building climate control
I noticed group hipster 20somethings standing near back first I assumed come sarcastically But Steves began speak grinned laughed absolute earnestness Everyone apparently superfan At one point Steves showed slide tourist swimming sunny French river underneath Roman aqueduct whole crowd gasped When mentioned website featured special video devoted packing light woman woman crowd actually pumped fist
At end talk Steves offered sign book traditional way There many people signing table said anyway singlefile line always inefficient This one travel credo avoid waiting line Instead sitting Steves walked center room invited everyone open book surround He pulled Sharpie And started spin Steves held pen signed book book book fluidly move smiling crowd pressed We went Portugal honeymoon man shouted How romantic Steves answered still spinning A woman asked celebrate Christmas Europe Steves midrotation still signing furiously told made whole special precisely question available free website Keep travelin Rick someone shouted Keep travelin Steves shouted back As spun Steves thanked everyone gave quick offthecuff advice In astonishingly short time signed every book The people satisfied The crowd thinned Steves finally came stop
Rick Steves absolutely American He wear jean every single day He drink frozen orange juice He like hash brown burned coffee extra hot He dislike fancy restaurant he road prefers buy footlong Subway sandwich split lunch dinner He great spontaneous honk laugh burst truly delighted sharpness firecracker Fourth July Steves completely American stop really look name realize name Rick followed plural Steve oneman crowd absolutely regular everyday American guy one Rick many Steves Although Steves spends nearly half life traveling insists passionately would never live anywhere United States know say absolutely true In fact Steves still life small Seattle suburb grew every morning walk work block downtown parent owned piano store 50 year ago On Sundays Steves wear jean church play conga great armpumping spirit inspirational softrock band serenade congregation service start sits sings classic Lutheran hymn without even needing refer hymnal Although Steves published many foreignlanguage phrase book language speaks fluently English He built business America raised kid America give frequent loving paean glory American life
And yet Rick Steves desperately want leave America The tiniest exposure outside world belief change entire life Travel Steves like say wallop ethnocentricity carbonate experience rearranges cultural furniture Like sealed window hot day nation border stultifying Steves want crack open let humanity breeze circulate The rootedly American Rick Steves want If never passport afraid world family would prefer vacation exclusively Walt Disney World worry foreigner rude predatory prone violence least food give diarrhea Steves want especially go Europe Then want go beyond For majority audience Steves say Europe wading pool world exploration Perhaps like need large headphone half tab Ambien properly relax flight Steves want know worth He want stand make little moaning sound cobblestone street first time taste authentic Italian gelato flavor pure seem like primordial essence peach melon pistachio rice distilled molecule stirred directly molecule He want hike dirt path along cliff almosttooblue Mediterranean village vineyard spilling rugged mountain He want arrive Parthenon dusk close tour group loading back onto cruise ship whole place stand feeling like private witness birth ruination Western civilization
Steves want go Europe long afford also want help afford Much guru energy focused cutting cost He want go many time possible youre want get way deep culture eat local teeming market make sympathetic fool get entirely lost lack America
Out paradoxical desire enlightenment Americans extraction America Steves built quirky travel empire His guidebook started handtyped photocopied information packet scraggly 1970s tour group dominate American market distinctive blueandyellow spine brighten travel section bookstore everywhere Steves le interested reaching sophisticated traveler converting uninitiated There rejoicing heaven one sinner repents Bible tell u 99 righteous person need repent Last year company led close 30000 paying customer dozen elaborate European itinerary Steves teach follower everything pack toiletry kit make home small hotel room appreciate religious tradition may raised despise In order enjoy St Peters Basilica Steves admits learn park Protestant sword door He sort spiritual travel agent Americas curious hesitant middle class He simultaneously goofy dead serious ping instant gollygee Pollyanna cheerfulness deep critique modern world In series long affectionate candid conversation Stevess colleague described using word sophomoric knucklehead Santa Claus also juggernaut evangelical revolutionary Rick Steves want u travel fun yes also belief might actually save world
I testify firsthand power Rick Steves In 1998 spoke college Nothing encounter seemed promising Our campus tiny outpost tiny town Steves delivered talk grand lecture hall drab room basement student union I poor shy anxious sheltered repressed extremely pale I particular kind Pacific Northwest white guy blind place world I never really traveled I comfortable Greyhound bus airplane Going Europe seemed like something aristocrat like fox hunting debutante ball
My girlfriend dragged talk I never even heard Steves He entered looking like kind guy would bring acoustic guitar every single church picnic within twohour radius favorite Applebees large glass floppy hair bluejeans wholesome grin But said next hour changed rest life
Its hard describe thoroughly energized Steves becomes front crowd He pace gesticulates speaks fast He tell favorite old joke eternally new Eet smell like zee foot angel French cheesemonger always exclaims Onstage combination preacher comedian salesman lifehacker professor inspirational speaker Steves told u day pack entire life single bag measuring 9 22 14 inch Its enlightened pack light Steves insists Its blessing pack light He told u find excellent cheap hotel survive minimalist picnic public park wash clothing bathroom sink make friend without sharing language Stevess signature book Europe Through Back Door seemed le like travel philosophy whole mode scrappy prepared independent extroverted Europes front door told u positioned feed traveler directly exploitation overpriced cafe trinket shop long line corporate highrise hotel The back door contrast led revelation He showed u impossibly enticing photo cobblestone piazza teeming fruit stall quirky wooden hotel among wildflower Alps vast arsenal multicolored cheese He made travel seem le like luxury necessary exploration self civic responsibility basic courtesy fellow human It seemed almost unreasonable go Above Steves told u afraid The people world wonderful planet share spectacular But way really understand go see So go
My girlfriend I left room convert gospel Rick Steves We bought book highlighted nearmeaninglessness We started mapping itinerary squirreling away money asking relative donation In probably worst phone call life rancher grandfather expressed shock dismay I would ask support meaningless overseas lark Eventually many month scraped together enough buy plane ticket order minimalist Stevesapproved supply including travel towel thin nonabsorbent seemed push moisture around skin forgot wet We packed exactly Steves taught u Tshirts rolled spacesaving noodle enough clothes get u one hotel laundry session next Then first time life left North America
One Stevess strongest recommendation keep journal Mine corny cover actually said A TRAVELERS NOTEBOOK picture Eiffel Tower When I opened recently reality longago trip hissed fresh urgency My 20yearold self recorded everything On first day Europe bought imported Austrian apple fat heavy English coin saw woman stumble staircase breaking entire bag newly bought china We arrived first hostel YMCA Bath find man urinating stairwell kept walking happened nearby churchyard gravestone old thin almost translucent As tried make name dead songbird sang strenuously tree around u This juxtaposition old death new life blew jetlagged American mind Already one day Bath I wrote journal world grown firmer Reality fill gap
That le theme trip For six week followed Steves game plan We shared squalid bunk young traveler Denmark Australia Canada Japan In stately public park Paris ate rotisserie chicken bare hand One stifling afternoon Colosseum Rome watched worker slam ladder edge arch break ancient brick He looked u looked brick kicked dirt kept working We moved Van Gogh Picasso Gaudí unmoved Versailles vain beautiful I wrote bullfighting brutal artful Goya vague blurry Once I left underwear Mediterranean beach overnight since I could afford lose pair go back pick next day full view sunbather
Wherever went Rick Steves u In journal I referred halfjokingly worldly uncle guiding light walked around I annoyed girlfriend impression We seemed entered world slide fruit market overnight train sunny French river ancient Roman aqueduct Sometimes European host quiet pride someone met Elvis told u story Steves He gentleman said truly good man always came person check hotel never failed ask child
By end trip completely broke We couldnt afford even baguette last day Paris We flew home looking ragged shaggy weatherbeaten exhausted


But course Steves right Our life never We still young Americans felt liberated empowered like true citizen world The important thing learned home As English writer GK Chesterton put quote I found printed corny old travel journal The whole object travel set foot foreign land last set foot one country foreign land After looking Roman stone wall topped Saxon stone wall topped medieval English wall next modern paved street I began see thin crust national history United States actually stand I began realize silly narrow notion exceptionalism impulse consider somehow immune force shape rest world The environment I grew mall freeway fantasy heroic individualism began seem unnatural I started sense much reality exists elsewhere world theoretical sense book movie full urgent weight real And Europe every continent time forever I began realize much I still learn I could pretend understand anything Not everyone need Stevess help get point Some people get community help But I needed I eternally glad I dragged day see talk
How eat Venice like Venetian
Steves answered front door slightly distracted I come middle breakfast preparation He stirring block frozen orange juice pitcher water Freshly squeezed quipped This April 2018 exactly 20 year first trip Europe I come see Steves exotic place possible home He life north Seattle town rainy free umbrellashare program There nothing particularly exotic house It beige carpeting professionally trimmed shrub back deck hot tub What exotic simply Steves He returned frenetic speaking tour United States would leaving almost immediately annual trip Europe For making breakfast frozen blueberry Kashi cereal OJ I would eat every day rest life I could said
But course could Steves gone much yoyoing misty forest Pacific Northwest sunbaked cathedral Europe Every year matter else going Steves spends least four month practicing kind travel preached 40odd year hauling backpack narrow staircase cheap hotel washing clothes sink improvising picnic
He 63 could afford retire many time But doesnt metabolism sitting around Among colleague Steves notorious workaholic After grueling day filming Europe known slip script revision crew door 2 ask breakfast feedback On long car ride sits back seat type opeds laptop His relentless handson control every aspect business distinguished Rick Steves brand
It also obviously exhausting Steves least people around He two child grown much childhood Steves gone He building company changing world For long stretch wife forced single mother She Steves divorced 2010 25 year marriage Every summer family joined Steves Europe pace hardly slackened They would cover major city 48 hour blitzing huge museum back back The kid complained much one trip Steves finally snapped miserable said could go sit hotel room day play video game They remember day heaven One year Steves away child converted Catholicism His son Andy Steves eventually went family business He work tour guide even published European guidebook
Steves fully aware obsessive work ethic unusual He admits regret But make stop He fervor true evangelist The people meet city visit life might change At one point talked pulled itinerary coming trip Sicily Iceland time whatsoever Just looking made giddy I asked couldnt ease slightly maybe spend two month Europe maybe speak 10 American city
Its strange thing said I get energy Its like Im breathing straight oxygen What would I I stayed home Not much Nothing I would remember
In house Steves offered little show tell He pointed antique silver cigarette lighter shaped like Space Needle He sat baby grand piano lost happy minute playing Scarlatti He took room filled book reached high shelf I dont show many people said theyll think Im nut Steves pulled thick red binder content indeed pretty nutty When Steves 13 decided apparent reason conduct deep statistical analysis 1968 Billboard pop chart Every week would clip ranking local newspaper using point system devising graph top band success sheet gridded paper The line multicolored interwoven looked like subway map fantastical foreign city You could see glance rising falling fortune Beatles red Creedence Clearwater Revival black Elvis Presley dot dash Steves kept three year taping together many piece graph paper end summarized data authoritativelooking table typed family typewriter This binder systematic breakdown successful band 1968 1970 determined objective statistic analytical adolescent weirdo The winner course Beatles 1739 point followed Creedence Simon Garfunkel Neil Diamond
Steves laughed It ridiculous But also perfect window mind Even 13 powerful energy coiled inside unusual combination obsession precision waiting worthwhile project burst
And coincidentally exactly found project life In summer 1969 Steves 14 parent took Europe They owned business tuning importing piano wanted see factory firsthand Steves approached first trip abroad meticulous energy brought Billboard graph As traveled around continent recorded essential data journey back postcard location activity weather expense One day Steves spent 40 cent fishing gear Another met 79yearold man witnessed assassination Archduke Franz Ferdinand To keep everything order Steves numbered postcard sequentially He still packed lovingly old wooden box
On formative trip Steves family visited relative Norway They happened July 1969 Neil Armstrong walked moon Ett lite skritt et menneske television said ett stort sprang menneskeheten In moment strange place young Rick Steves felt concept menneskeheten mankind depth never would able access back home Europe crash course cultural relativity In park Oslo epiphany The foreign human around realized leading existence every bit rich full Right would write later 14yearold egocentric worldview took huge hit A lifechanging realization clicked place This planet must home billion equally lovable child God
That first trip set course everything followed When Steves 18 went back Europe without parent Soon life America became series interlude travel He taught piano earn money stretched money far possibly could sleeping church pew park bench empty barn construction zone Western Europe Afghanistan He turned cheapness science Instead paying hotel room city Steves would use Railpass sleep train night four hour four hour back He would stuff free breakfast bread try eat little possible rest day Naturally recorded today impressive archive old travel journal Their page preserve tiny handwriting shadowy young dissident Moscow diarrhea Bulgaria revolution Nicaragua
In 20 Steves brought wideroaming wisdom back United States He started supplement piano teaching travel seminar His signature class European Travel Cheap ran six hour Steves could talked longer struck impractical student In Europe rented nineseat minibus started lead small tour Eventually seminar tour note morphed book The first edition Europe Through Back Door published 1980 typed rented IBM Selectric It ISBN looked amateurish bookstore assumed early review copy Anyone caught reprinting material herein purpose whatsoever thanked profusely said This birth Rick Steves empire
Rick Steves TV persona Offscreen allows much explicitly political He passion autodidact Growing Steves led relatively sheltered existence He white comfortable middleclass baby boomer white comfortable middleclass pocket America Travel promise everyone else It put contact reality He saw desperate poverty Iran became obsessed economic injustice He started searching answer book scribbling note margin Bread World Arthur Simon The Origins Totalitarianism Hannah Arendt He studied war industry colonial exploitation The first time Steves traveled Central America came back outraged wrote fiery tract called Theres Blood Your Banana flew Washington handdelivered copy office every member Congress
In early day Steves injected political lesson European tour Sometimes would arrive city hotel reservation make privileged customer feel anxiety homelessness In Munich would set camp infamous hippie circus tent among countercultural wanderer Europe
Today Steves strategic His powerful tool realizes broad appeal He uncanny knack making serious criticism feel gentle friendly Often disguise critique America rhetorical move I like think USA USA USA But Im unapologetically proud American writes introduction book Travel Political Act The happiest day trip day I come home But nation pretty good idea
Thats hit audience legal prostitution high tax rate universal health care
When I asked Steves strategy chuckled
Its Americabashing said Its Americaloving I think loving America look critically But youve got set Youve got allay people concern youre communist So explain Im capitalist I make lot money I employ lot people I love law supply demand It seems kind silly youve got say Then especially husband dragged wife go I thought commie he OK And dont need gentle You confront people different perspective youll get
Steves learned strategy said early day running tour living people week time Survival required pleasant People didnt want grating lecture Americas shortcoming even sometimes instinct Instead pointed different perspective smile He became fluent need American tourist I know button said I know attention span I dont want preach choir I want preach organization need hear I need compromise little bit gatekeeper let world
This balancing act become increasingly difficult past two decade world terrorism war nationalism metastasizing partisanship After Sept 11 attack travel company anticipated bottom fall market They canceled tour cut back budget Steves however remained defiantly optimistic He promised staff would cut layoff shift message He insisted world crisis needed travel le Soon shock Sept 11 turned Iraq war strained relationship United States even closest European ally sending travel industry deeper trough In hometown Steves caused controversy walked around removing row American flag set support war It argued act patriotism The flag meant represent Americans war supporter I sharkbait Seattles rightwing radio talk show several day wrote
Lately Steves concedes political message begun take teaching In Travel Political Act familiar element guidebook walking tour museum guide hotel review replaced rabblerousing cultural critique Steves express deep admiration Scandinavianstyle social democracy call many Americas fault addiction car gun mass incarceration deference corporation long history cultural imperialism one ugliest thing one nation write another nation textbook Some moment book verge unAmerican Sometimes Im frustrated impact American foreign policy developing world Steves writes I feeling impotent America better world America whose power isnt always used good
Occasionally despite best effort Steves still ruffle feather Recent TV special covered Iran I believe youre going bomb place Steves written know people first rise fascism Europe In special Holy Land Steves refers unapologetically Palestine instead West Bank Palestinian territory viewer outraged told Steves removing PBS will After one recent speech Deep South event organizer refused pay Steves conservative sponsor learned considered message form liberal propaganda
In recent year Steves become happy warrior unlikely cause legalization marijuana He first tried drug Afghanistan 1970s name cultural immersion fascinated effect mind Today board member Norml National Organization Reform Marijuana Laws regular speaker Hempfest In headquarters find poster Mona Lisa holding gargantuan spliff In 2012 Steves campaigned hard Washington States successful legalization initiative since barnstormed state Oregon Maine Vermont make sure civil liberty properly passed around On shelf living room right among European knickknack Steves display sizable bong
Sometimes fan urge Steves run office When I asked would ever get politics answer ready I already Good travel teaching eye inherently political To stay familyowned hotel Bulgaria strengthen global democracy pack light break iron logic consumerism ride train across Europe challenge fossilfuel industry Travel Steves frivolous luxury engine improving humankind connecting people removing prejudice knocking distant culture together make unlikely spark joy insight Given million people encountered work Steves last 40 year TV online guidebook carried lesson untold million people fair say life work real effect collective life planet When people tell Steves stay politics stick travel laugh
Its flattering think I could run office admitted And would exciting But I think Im accomplishing right I would office Im fun Im skiing beautiful wax ski When I want something I
Steves deeply indifferent creature comfort When I visited back seat car covered greenish slime practically disintegrating mysterious leak He cracked window try dry Steves prefers spend money favorite cause His activism quirky impulsive In 2011 hearing local symphony orchestra struggling stepped gift 1 million spread 10 year help keep operating This pointedly much money would get back President George W Bushs tax cut decade Last year chat one national leader Lutheran Church Steves wondered much would cost send every single Lutheran congregation United States DVD recent TV special Martin Luther It something like 30000 Steves happily wrote check In 1990s working partnership YWCA started investing retirement saving local real estate order house homeless mother child The plan take money banking system let decade social good point Steves could sell building fund retirement Eventually worked way buying whole 24unit apartment complex donated outright YWCA The mother said needed would
Steves obsessed problem poverty amazed perpetual misunderstanding Its You screwed youre poor said Theres structure keep half humanity poor This need talked I I get away His next TV special production investigate extreme poverty hunger two different nonEuropean country Guatemala Ethiopia In meantime royalty latest book updated edition Travel Political Act donated Bread World organization lobby behalf hungry people He working making company tour completely carbonneutral
If I trying build career speaking circuit I struggling I needed gig I would talk stuff said I could talk light stuff everybody would love But Im working right Im trying get anywhere Im already I dont need anything Im Im 63 year old I could retire But Im ramping
Indeed Stevess business booming Once travel market finally recovered year Sept 11 Steves occupied disproportionately big share precisely refused scale back By taking principled stand Steves flourished Today chipper voice reaching Americans ever Fear Steves like say people dont get much
4 stop womanfocused trip Seoul
One night living room Steves pulled plain black notebook Heres something might find interesting said trademark cheer flipped open random page prepared read aloud I familiar Stevess deep archive old travel journal I settled listen adventure 1975 Moscow 1997 Paris This however something else entirely record different kind journey

He continued read

A baby doesnt know hanging wall wall hanging
Make rug vacuum mark always look freshly vacuumed
The entry covered impressively wide territory Some little shred oracular poetry We divine harness others dashedoff semiwitticisms Wolfgang von Bewildered bitter social critique The spiritual cesspool America shopping mall They dont let heaven without callus soul read one point Suffer weep There scrap humorous dialogue Nothing wrong ego bellowed sentence would made great bumper sticker rusting VW bus Id like quarantined reality
I found wondering thousandth time Who What kind mind think project actually follows decade decade decade Who Gods sake disciplined theyre high
As Steves read interrupted great shouting honk laughter I cackled right along Then suddenly almost transition would find deep earnest conversation nature true happiness danger ambition And would suddenly cackling We word getting high Stevess High Notes
He kept reading
Ive craning mind see said
I feel like hungry bird I wont eat worm I dont like
Steves showed complex analytical graph true love divorce rate way music sound youre high versus sober degree honesty possible various people life Scale Unconditional Regard last one called One page journal strand hair taped labeled split end There drawing woman breast And course many many description getting high Getting high like roasting English muffin Steves read You start cold doughy toast crisp brown little get black burned

Read profile Terry Gross host Fresh Air
Eventually Stevess busy New York day ended Upper East Side scheduled give talk Barnes Noble As drove event Steves confessed wasnt sure kind crowd would get You never knew exactly Rickniks hardcore fan call would materialize en masse Some Steves appearance mobbed others sparse His appeal slightly cultish For every Ricknik world large contingent average people idea
I mildly skeptical Stevess drawing power New York It hard imagine bunch cynical worldly urban polyglot multicultural East Coast sophisticate people probably vacationed deconsecrated ecohostels Oman Madagascar getting excited public television reigning expert Europe
We arrived however find bookstore overflowing A solid wave applause met Steves door Fans pouring organizer told u two solid hour People sat aisle stood back Some wore Tshirts hat bearing Rick Steves slogan Keep Travelin The crowd body heat overwhelmed building climate control
I noticed group hipster 20somethings standing near back first I assumed come sarcastically But Steves began speak grinned laughed absolute earnestness Everyone apparently superfan At one point Steves showed slide tourist swimming sunny French river underneath Roman aqueduct whole crowd gasped When mentioned website featured special video devoted packing light woman woman crowd actually pumped fist
At end talk Steves offered sign book traditional way There many people signing table said anyway singlefile line always inefficient This one travel credo avoid waiting line Instead sitting Steves walked center room invited everyone open book surround He pulled Sharpie And started spin Steves held pen signed book book book fluidly move smiling crowd pressed We went Portugal honeymoon man shouted How romantic Steves answered still spinning A woman asked celebrate Christmas Europe Steves midrotation still signing furiously told made whole special precisely question available free website Keep travelin Rick someone shouted Keep travelin Steves shouted back As spun Steves thanked everyone gave quick offthecuff advice In astonishingly short time signed every book The people satisfied The crowd thinned Steves finally came stop
Rick Steves absolutely American He wear jean every single day He drink frozen orange juice He like hash brown burned coffee extra hot He dislike fancy restaurant he road prefers buy footlong Subway sandwich split lunch dinner He great spontaneous honk laugh burst truly delighted sharpness firecracker Fourth July Steves completely American stop really look name realize name Rick followed plural Steve oneman crowd absolutely regular everyday American guy one Rick many Steves Although Steves spends nearly half life traveling insists passionately would never live anywhere United States know say absolutely true In fact Steves still life small Seattle suburb grew every morning walk work block downtown parent owned piano store 50 year ago On Sundays Steves wear jean church play conga great armpumping spirit inspirational softrock band serenade congregation service start sits sings classic Lutheran hymn without even needing refer hymnal Although Steves published many foreignlanguage phrase book language speaks fluently English He built business America raised kid America give frequent loving paean glory American life
And yet Rick Steves desperately want leave America The tiniest exposure outside world belief change entire life Travel Steves like say wallop ethnocentricity carbonate experience rearranges cultural furniture Like sealed window hot day nation border stultifying Steves want crack open let humanity breeze circulate The rootedly American Rick Steves want If never passport afraid world family would prefer vacation exclusively Walt Disney World worry foreigner rude predatory prone violence least food give diarrhea Steves want especially go Europe Then want go beyond For majority audience Steves say Europe wading pool world exploration Perhaps like need large headphone half tab Ambien properly relax flight Steves want know worth He want stand make little moaning sound cobblestone street first time taste authentic Italian gelato flavor pure seem like primordial essence peach melon pistachio rice distilled molecule stirred directly molecule He want hike dirt path along cliff almosttooblue Mediterranean village vineyard spilling rugged mountain He want arrive Parthenon dusk close tour group loading back onto cruise ship whole place stand feeling like private witness birth ruination Western civilization
Steves want go Europe long afford also want help afford Much guru energy focused cutting cost He want go many time possible youre want get way deep culture eat local teeming market make sympathetic fool get entirely lost lack America
Out paradoxical desire enlightenment Americans extraction America Steves built quirky travel empire His guidebook started handtyped photocopied information packet scraggly 1970s tour group dominate American market distinctive blueandyellow spine brighten travel section bookstore everywhere Steves le interested reaching sophisticated traveler converting uninitiated There rejoicing heaven one sinner repents Bible tell u 99 righteous person need repent Last year company led close 30000 paying customer dozen elaborate European itinerary Steves teach follower everything pack toiletry kit make home small hotel room appreciate religious tradition may raised despise In order enjoy St Peters Basilica Steves admits learn park Protestant sword door He sort spiritual travel agent Americas curious hesitant middle class He simultaneously goofy dead serious ping instant gollygee Pollyanna cheerfulness deep critique modern world In series long affectionate candid conversation Stevess colleague described using word sophomoric knucklehead Santa Claus also juggernaut evangelical revolutionary Rick Steves want u travel fun yes also belief might actually save world
I testify firsthand power Rick Steves In 1998 spoke college Nothing encounter seemed promising Our campus tiny outpost tiny town Steves delivered talk grand lecture hall drab room basement student union I poor shy anxious sheltered repressed extremely pale I particular kind Pacific Northwest white guy blind place world I never really traveled I comfortable Greyhound bus airplane Going Europe seemed like something aristocrat like fox hunting debutante ball
My girlfriend dragged talk I never even heard Steves He entered looking like kind guy would bring acoustic guitar every single church picnic within twohour radius favorite Applebees large glass floppy hair bluejeans wholesome grin But said next hour changed rest life
Its hard describe thoroughly energized Steves becomes front crowd He pace gesticulates speaks fast He tell favorite old joke eternally new Eet smell like zee foot angel French cheesemonger always exclaims Onstage combination preacher comedian salesman lifehacker professor inspirational speaker Steves told u day pack entire life single bag measuring 9 22 14 inch Its enlightened pack light Steves insists Its blessing pack light He told u find excellent cheap hotel survive minimalist picnic public park wash clothing bathroom sink make friend without sharing language Stevess signature book Europe Through Back Door seemed le like travel philosophy whole mode scrappy prepared independent extroverted Europes front door told u positioned feed traveler directly exploitation overpriced cafe trinket shop long line corporate highrise hotel The back door contrast led revelation He showed u impossibly enticing photo cobblestone piazza teeming fruit stall quirky wooden hotel among wildflower Alps vast arsenal multicolored cheese He made travel seem le like luxury necessary exploration self civic responsibility basic courtesy fellow human It seemed almost unreasonable go Above Steves told u afraid The people world wonderful planet share spectacular But way really understand go see So go
My girlfriend I left room convert gospel Rick Steves We bought book highlighted nearmeaninglessness We started mapping itinerary squirreling away money asking relative donation In probably worst phone call life rancher grandfather expressed shock dismay I would ask support meaningless overseas lark Eventually many month scraped together enough buy plane ticket order minimalist Stevesapproved supply including travel towel thin nonabsorbent seemed push moisture around skin forgot wet We packed exactly Steves taught u Tshirts rolled spacesaving noodle enough clothes get u one hotel laundry session next Then first time life left North America
One Stevess strongest recommendation keep journal Mine corny cover actually said A TRAVELERS NOTEBOOK picture Eiffel Tower When I opened recently reality longago trip hissed fresh urgency My 20yearold self recorded everything On first day Europe bought imported Austrian apple fat heavy English coin saw woman stumble staircase breaking entire bag newly bought china We arrived first hostel YMCA Bath find man urinating stairwell kept walking happened nearby churchyard gravestone old thin almost translucent As tried make name dead songbird sang strenuously tree around u This juxtaposition old death new life blew jetlagged American mind Already one day Bath I wrote journal world grown firmer Reality fill gap
That le theme trip For six week followed Steves game plan We shared squalid bunk young traveler Denmark Australia Canada Japan In stately public park Paris ate rotisserie chicken bare hand One stifling afternoon Colosseum Rome watched worker slam ladder edge arch break ancient brick He looked u looked brick kicked dirt kept working We moved Van Gogh Picasso Gaudí unmoved Versailles vain beautiful I wrote bullfighting brutal artful Goya vague blurry Once I left underwear Mediterranean beach overnight since I could afford lose pair go back pick next day full view sunbather
Wherever went Rick Steves u In journal I referred halfjokingly worldly uncle guiding light walked around I annoyed girlfriend impression We seemed entered world slide fruit market overnight train sunny French river ancient Roman aqueduct Sometimes European host quiet pride someone met Elvis told u story Steves He gentleman said truly good man always came person check hotel never failed ask child
By end trip completely broke We couldnt afford even baguette last day Paris We flew home looking ragged shaggy weatherbeaten exhausted


But course Steves right Our life never We still young Americans felt liberated empowered like true citizen world The important thing learned home As English writer GK Chesterton put quote I found printed corny old travel journal The whole object travel set foot foreign land last set foot one country foreign land After looking Roman stone wall topped Saxon stone wall topped medieval English wall next modern paved street I began see thin crust national history United States actually stand I began realize silly narrow notion exceptionalism impulse consider somehow immune force shape rest world The environment I grew mall freeway fantasy heroic individualism began seem unnatural I started sense much reality exists elsewhere world theoretical sense book movie full urgent weight real And Europe every continent time forever I began realize much I still learn I could pretend understand anything Not everyone need Stevess help get point Some people get community help But I needed I eternally glad I dragged day see talk
How eat Venice like Venetian
Steves answered front door slightly distracted I come middle breakfast preparation He stirring block frozen orange juice pitcher water Freshly squeezed quipped This April 2018 exactly 20 year first trip Europe I come see Steves exotic place possible home He life north Seattle town rainy free umbrellashare program There nothing particularly exotic house It beige carpeting professionally trimmed shrub back deck hot tub What exotic simply Steves He returned frenetic speaking tour United States would leaving almost immediately annual trip Europe For making breakfast frozen blueberry Kashi cereal OJ I would eat every day rest life I could said
But course could Steves gone much yoyoing misty forest Pacific Northwest sunbaked cathedral Europe Every year matter else going Steves spends least four month practicing kind travel preached 40odd year hauling backpack narrow staircase cheap hotel washing clothes sink improvising picnic
He 63 could afford retire many time But doesnt metabolism sitting around Among colleague Steves notorious workaholic After grueling day filming Europe known slip script revision crew door 2 ask breakfast feedback On long car ride sits back seat type opeds laptop His relentless handson control every aspect business distinguished Rick Steves brand
It also obviously exhausting Steves least people around He two child grown much childhood Steves gone He building company changing world For long stretch wife forced single mother She Steves divorced 2010 25 year marriage Every summer family joined Steves Europe pace hardly slackened They would cover major city 48 hour blitzing huge museum back back The kid complained much one trip Steves finally snapped miserable said could go sit hotel room day play video game They remember day heaven One year Steves away child converted Catholicism His son Andy Steves eventually went family business He work tour guide even published European guidebook
Steves fully aware obsessive work ethic unusual He admits regret But make stop He fervor true evangelist The people meet city visit life might change At one point talked pulled itinerary coming trip Sicily Iceland time whatsoever Just looking made giddy I asked couldnt ease slightly maybe spend two month Europe maybe speak 10 American city
Its strange thing said I get energy Its like Im breathing straight oxygen What would I I stayed home Not much Nothing I would remember
In house Steves offered little show tell He pointed antique silver cigarette lighter shaped like Space Needle He sat baby grand piano lost happy minute playing Scarlatti He took room filled book reached high shelf I dont show many people said theyll think Im nut Steves pulled thick red binder content indeed pretty nutty When Steves 13 decided apparent reason conduct deep statistical analysis 1968 Billboard pop chart Every week would clip ranking local newspaper using point system devising graph top band success sheet gridded paper The line multicolored interwoven looked like subway map fantastical foreign city You could see glance rising falling fortune Beatles red Creedence Clearwater Revival black Elvis Presley dot dash Steves kept three year taping together many piece graph paper end summarized data authoritativelooking table typed family typewriter This binder systematic breakdown successful band 1968 1970 determined objective statistic analytical adolescent weirdo The winner course Beatles 1739 point followed Creedence Simon Garfunkel Neil Diamond
Steves laughed It ridiculous But also perfect window mind Even 13 powerful energy coiled inside unusual combination obsession precision waiting worthwhile project burst
And coincidentally exactly found project life In summer 1969 Steves 14 parent took Europe They owned business tuning importing piano wanted see factory firsthand Steves approached first trip abroad meticulous energy brought Billboard graph As traveled around continent recorded essential data journey back postcard location activity weather expense One day Steves spent 40 cent fishing gear Another met 79yearold man witnessed assassination Archduke Franz Ferdinand To keep everything order Steves numbered postcard sequentially He still packed lovingly old wooden box
On formative trip Steves family visited relative Norway They happened July 1969 Neil Armstrong walked moon Ett lite skritt et menneske television said ett stort sprang menneskeheten In moment strange place young Rick Steves felt concept menneskeheten mankind depth never would able access back home Europe crash course cultural relativity In park Oslo epiphany The foreign human around realized leading existence every bit rich full Right would write later 14yearold egocentric worldview took huge hit A lifechanging realization clicked place This planet must home billion equally lovable child God
That first trip set course everything followed When Steves 18 went back Europe without parent Soon life America became series interlude travel He taught piano earn money stretched money far possibly could sleeping church pew park bench empty barn construction zone Western Europe Afghanistan He turned cheapness science Instead paying hotel room city Steves would use Railpass sleep train night four hour four hour back He would stuff free breakfast bread try eat little possible rest day Naturally recorded today impressive archive old travel journal Their page preserve tiny handwriting shadowy young dissident Moscow diarrhea Bulgaria revolution Nicaragua
In 20 Steves brought wideroaming wisdom back United States He started supplement piano teaching travel seminar His signature class European Travel Cheap ran six hour Steves could talked longer struck impractical student In Europe rented nineseat minibus started lead small tour Eventually seminar tour note morphed book The first edition Europe Through Back Door published 1980 typed rented IBM Selectric It ISBN looked amateurish bookstore assumed early review copy Anyone caught reprinting material herein purpose whatsoever thanked profusely said This birth Rick Steves empire
Rick Steves TV persona Offscreen allows much explicitly political He passion autodidact Growing Steves led relatively sheltered existence He white comfortable middleclass baby boomer white comfortable middleclass pocket America Travel promise everyone else It put contact reality He saw desperate poverty Iran became obsessed economic injustice He started searching answer book scribbling note margin Bread World Arthur Simon The Origins Totalitarianism Hannah Arendt He studied war industry colonial exploitation The first time Steves traveled Central America came back outraged wrote fiery tract called Theres Blood Your Banana flew Washington handdelivered copy office every member Congress
In early day Steves injected political lesson European tour Sometimes would arrive city hotel reservation make privileged customer feel anxiety homelessness In Munich would set camp infamous hippie circus tent among countercultural wanderer Europe
Today Steves strategic His powerful tool realizes broad appeal He uncanny knack making serious criticism feel gentle friendly Often disguise critique America rhetorical move I like think USA USA USA But Im unapologetically proud American writes introduction book Travel Political Act The happiest day trip day I come home But nation pretty good idea
Thats hit audience legal prostitution high tax rate universal health care
When I asked Steves strategy chuckled
Its Americabashing said Its Americaloving I think loving America look critically But youve got set Youve got allay people concern youre communist So explain Im capitalist I make lot money I employ lot people I love law supply demand It seems kind silly youve got say Then especially husband dragged wife go I thought commie he OK And dont need gentle You confront people different perspective youll get
Steves learned strategy said early day running tour living people week time Survival required pleasant People didnt want grating lecture Americas shortcoming even sometimes instinct Instead pointed different perspective smile He became fluent need American tourist I know button said I know attention span I dont want preach choir I want preach organization need hear I need compromise little bit gatekeeper let world
This balancing act become increasingly difficult past two decade world terrorism war nationalism metastasizing partisanship After Sept 11 attack travel company anticipated bottom fall market They canceled tour cut back budget Steves however remained defiantly optimistic He promised staff would cut layoff shift message He insisted world crisis needed travel le Soon shock Sept 11 turned Iraq war strained relationship United States even closest European ally sending travel industry deeper trough In hometown Steves caused controversy walked around removing row American flag set support war It argued act patriotism The flag meant represent Americans war supporter I sharkbait Seattles rightwing radio talk show several day wrote
Lately Steves concedes political message begun take teaching In Travel Political Act familiar element guidebook walking tour museum guide hotel review replaced rabblerousing cultural critique Steves express deep admiration Scandinavianstyle social democracy call many Americas fault addiction car gun mass incarceration deference corporation long history cultural imperialism one ugliest thing one nation write another nation textbook Some moment book verge unAmerican Sometimes Im frustrated impact American foreign policy developing world Steves writes I feeling impotent America better world America whose power isnt always used good
Occasionally despite best effort Steves still ruffle feather Recent TV special covered Iran I believe youre going bomb place Steves written know people first rise fascism Europe In special Holy Land Steves refers unapologetically Palestine instead West Bank Palestinian territory viewer outraged told Steves removing PBS will After one recent speech Deep South event organizer refused pay Steves conservative sponsor learned considered message form liberal propaganda
In recent year Steves become happy warrior unlikely cause legalization marijuana He first tried drug Afghanistan 1970s name cultural immersion fascinated effect mind Today board member Norml National Organization Reform Marijuana Laws regular speaker Hempfest In headquarters find poster Mona Lisa holding gargantuan spliff In 2012 Steves campaigned hard Washington States successful legalization initiative since barnstormed state Oregon Maine Vermont make sure civil liberty properly passed around On shelf living room right among European knickknack Steves display sizable bong
Sometimes fan urge Steves run office When I asked would ever get politics answer ready I already Good travel teaching eye inherently political To stay familyowned hotel Bulgaria strengthen global democracy pack light break iron logic consumerism ride train across Europe challenge fossilfuel industry Travel Steves frivolous luxury engine improving humankind connecting people removing prejudice knocking distant culture together make unlikely spark joy insight Given million people encountered work Steves last 40 year TV online guidebook carried lesson untold million people fair say life work real effect collective life planet When people tell Steves stay politics stick travel laugh
Its flattering think I could run office admitted And would exciting But I think Im accomplishing right I would office Im fun Im skiing beautiful wax ski When I want something I
Steves deeply indifferent creature comfort When I visited back seat car covered greenish slime practically disintegrating mysterious leak He cracked window try dry Steves prefers spend money favorite cause His activism quirky impulsive In 2011 hearing local symphony orchestra struggling stepped gift 1 million spread 10 year help keep operating This pointedly much money would get back President George W Bushs tax cut decade Last year chat one national leader Lutheran Church Steves wondered much would cost send every single Lutheran congregation United States DVD recent TV special Martin Luther It something like 30000 Steves happily wrote check In 1990s working partnership YWCA started investing retirement saving local real estate order house homeless mother child The plan take money banking system let decade social good point Steves could sell building fund retirement Eventually worked way buying whole 24unit apartment complex donated outright YWCA The mother said needed would
Steves obsessed problem poverty amazed perpetual misunderstanding Its You screwed youre poor said Theres structure keep half humanity poor This need talked I I get away His next TV special production investigate extreme poverty hunger two different nonEuropean country Guatemala Ethiopia In meantime royalty latest book updated edition Travel Political Act donated Bread World organization lobby behalf hungry people He working making company tour completely carbonneutral
If I trying build career speaking circuit I struggling I needed gig I would talk stuff said I could talk light stuff everybody would love But Im working right Im trying get anywhere Im already I dont need anything Im Im 63 year old I could retire But Im ramping
Indeed Stevess business booming Once travel market finally recovered year Sept 11 Steves occupied disproportionately big share precisely refused scale back By taking principled stand Steves flourished Today chipper voice reaching Americans ever Fear Steves like say people dont get much

A weeklong trip Alaska supposed adventure In instant became experience defined u

The whale sighting happened right away minute Day 1 Jon Dave I dropped remote Alaskan shoreline hour half boat closest speck town Jon working seakayaking guide summer Glacier Bay National Park invited u sevenday excursion week As boat delivered u vanished drone engine dampening murmur finally trailing became unthinkably quiet beach largeness strangeness surroundings suddenly apparent It familiar phenomenon Jon start trip moment people instinctually paused soak To felt like scene astronaut finally rattled free earth atmosphere slip stillness space Except werent space We earth finally really earth
We starting move around packing gear kayak heard first huff blowhole far offshore
Jon ecstatic It seemed animal putting show swimming playfully kelp diving resurfacing plowing open mouth across surface feed He took good omen Though I idea time anxious Dave I might feel intimidated making trip big payoff quickly would get u excited defuse apprehension
For Dave whalesighting exactly opposite effect Once kid dad took scuba diving dolphin They friendly aweinspiring creature purportedly terrified Dave instead He could still conjure feeling hanging defenselessly water animal deftly swirled around le like solid object flash reflected light could move comparative slowmotion Ever since harbored fear large sea creature niche phobia particularly young man lived Bronx genuine one still And even Dave understood chance see whale close like major draw kayaking trip Alaska though feigned thrilled second thought kicking We going realized
The whale left exhilarated gleeful like Jon deeper I also remember feeling shaken like Dave Nothing animal registered playful welcoming It appeared distance transited quickly past u left right My uneasiness something whale great size indifference obliviousness passed Watching made feel profoundly place register large wilderness relative
At time I working literary magazine New York City called The Hudson Review picking poem slush pile mailing outside panel editorial adviser I trying hard letter impress one Hayden Carruth gruff irreverent 81yearold poet lived far upstate I loved Carruths work enamored persona yeoman life wood intolerance phoniness precision articulated common suffering including one strain suffering I related particularly year wouldnt courage clarity examine
I always aware Carruth wrote youth Universe sad everything animate inanimate wild creature stone star enveloped great sadness pervaded Never I able look cloudless sky night see beauty A kind grandeur yes beauty The profusion variety celestial light always frightened Why Why instead others Why instead nothing
That I felt watching whale beach afraid everything accident Then maybe hard picture start trip retrospect without amplifying feeling foreboding Something else Carruth wrote always stuck The wilderness begin edge body edge consciousness extends edge universe filled menace
Read Aleksander Doba 71yearold kayaked across Atlantic 3 time
It midAugust 2002 23 24 25 We graduated college together two year earlier Dave I also grew shot undergrad knowing wanted doctor finished first year medical school Any similar momentum I graduation instantly sapped Three night I returned parent house school I found driving father emergency room Three week died My grief disorienting total moment life everything supposed feel possible making single decision became impossible I gave sadness better part year resettling home New Jersey widowed mother sliding back summer job I worked school glumly breaking beef butcher shop two town
I coped fatherlessness confusion way Im proud still dont understand I read lot book Ronald Reagan example even collection love letter Nancy I also lashed Dave living home summer studying MCAT He withdrew awkwardly funeral I suppose I happy hold It triggered longstanding jealousy A part always resented seemed unfairly exempt selfdoubt heaviness I prone
Jon meanwhile teaching rustic little boarding school Switzerland mother The summer graduation starting job set Alaska friend sleeping bed old pickup In minuscule town Gustavus gateway Glacier Bay picked seasonal work warehouse kayaktour company Jon little actual experience sea kayaking always felt drawn ocean abstract In college another friend plotted paddling expedition near Glacier Bay across border Canada applied grant school fund The grant set memory alumnus died avalanche mountaineering It meant encourage responsible conscientious pursuit wilderness expedition Safety key But committee rejected Jon partner application They seemed insufficiently prepared
That wasnt surprising Jon grew lot backcountry camping competent outdoorsman putting together grant application required kind administrative fastidiousness didnt always posse He bright scatterbrained forever picking thing putting figuratively music project conversation also literally I still picture hustling around house shared college hunting key soldering iron gotten head rewiring device He artist one piece I remember consisted halfpeeled banana implanted circuitry suspended jar formaldehyde Once grew grass upstairs bathroom living bathmat said turf became muddy flooded downstairs
This Jons third summer Alaska hed worked way leading expedition taking vacationer day time Our trip however would venture beyond typical circuit remote corner park hed never Jon serious concern safety felt bore responsibility emotional wellbeing To enjoy would need feel comfortable wilderness also leader
He suspected wouldnt trust entirely We didnt We knew became professional guide perception expertise lagged behind reality With Jon Dave told always unclear extent hed thought everything Dave remembered landing Gustavus night got underway casually asking Jon lot question Where going exactly Do everything need Jon seemed solid answer As headed back place good night sleep told u wait yard He living alone summer house acquaintance building wood The structure framedup largely wallless Jon safe needed check moose wandered
After spectacular first day paddling came ashore rocky tidal flat two mile dropped Jon gave u detailed tutorial bear safety set campsite He taught u example holler Hey bear heard rustling also preventively ahead u walked wood The last thing wanted come across brown bear unannounced
Hey bear Jon kept hollering way demonstration He said goofily like childrens TV host greeting downonhisluck ursine neighbor doorway clubhouse This intentional Jon noticed people trip often resisted bellowing Hey bear wilderness It essential safety felt silly vulnerable somehow like singing public So learned turn shtick spinning streamofconsciousness narration Hey bear Im coming tree Hope youre fantastic evening Mr Bear It loosened everyone They performing friend whole group joke
I never seen wild bear though I backpacked bear country handful time I felt comfortable animal abstract But bear werent abstract breached material plane There bear trail everywhere leading tree line water disquietingly close I felt pitching tent We found heap scat We saw tree animal slashed bark eat inner layer tuft fur paw still plastered sap
I pretended I fun But evening I grew increasingly petrified almost delirious My eye tightened scanning bear The sound wind became bear mossy stick cracking foot I gave migraine phased sleep
At sunrise I woke feeling foolish While Jon cooked pancake I reasoned privately notebook I brought trip I tried conceive situation geometry problem Yes number bear roved landscape I wrote relatively tiny independent blip going business randomly like u In empty space confusion lethal collision moving blip moving blip would improbable coincidence Id distorting odds mistaking absolute focus bear attention I wrote It embarrassing really To afraid bear I concluded narcissistic
I reminding freakishly horrible thing definition unlikely happen Even reasoning feel sound

Day 2 slog We paddled spitting drizzle endless straight line along high granite wall coast We talked le le pushed emerald chop Then eventually gave hauling boat making camp wide crescentshaped cove short site Jon originally picked map
We entered Dundas Bay rarely visited pocket national park Ive since learned storied history hideout solitary misanthrope In 1930s one prospector built cabin far campsite brandished gun Alaska Natives passed
We intuited scenery beautiful could see little fog Our guidebook explained east side bay get extremely rough foul weather since large wave roll batter shoreline That happening The weather plinked u afternoon roiling storm Soon big rain started We rushed dinner loafed tent eventually loafing turned sleep
A local newspaper would later describe storm short intense In Gustavus creek swelled foot higher previous record Gale wind gust 59 mile per hour turned back two cruise ship Skagway 85 mile north Around 2 woke discover wind shorn rain fly tent Jons sleeping bag mine soaked Dave snug dry u We heard torrent water lashing wave crashing cove
We got three four hour later The rain wind longer felt ferocious still gnarly paddle question Jon said staying put We cooked breakfast took turn playing chess tent By late morning storm seemed passed We antsy We figured would take look around
The terrain crammed thicket alder spruce underlain fern furor prickly thing Jon pointed devil club three four foot tall leafy armored spine The plant pierced fleece hurt like fire
There trail Wed trudging time reached fastmoving stream maybe 10 foot wide Jon surprised wasnt map likely drainage bloated storm We followed downstream looking way across eventually found bridged hefty tree trunk It seemed like easy crossing Jon stepped led way Dave I waited singlefile line stream bank behind The creek loud like factory gear roller churning Looking Jon realized water hed thought
Thats I heard snap wood behind After paranoia I instantly understood many bear Id thought I heard absolutely bear nothing sound unmistakable crisp explicitly something I turned hollered Hey bear waited beat Maybe I said Hey bear Im sure But I must scanned tree long enough feel satisfied safe I know I turning head go back friend I saw dark shape rushing forward peripheral vision
What I heard must root popping If tree large enough apparently hear cracking underground like gunfire
The thud seismic The trunk crashed right next Mapping bit evidence later concluded tree must 80 foot tall perhaps two foot diameter It kind conifer spruce cedar I screamed involuntarily Look watched Dave step directly front dive sideways hit ground When I got crouching stunned OK He looked said Go get Jon
It hadnt clicked back There three u The sight Dave going canceled everything else I scrambled creek running across tree fallen shouting Jons name spotted water tangled snarl shearedoff branch near bank behind cage kept hurtling downstream
He know hed hit falling tree It narrowly missed head struck left shoulder shearing collarbone breaking many rib Later doctor would explain downward force powerful probably squashed Jons entire upper body organ inside toward waist momentarily compressing like bellow split second shoulder headed direction bellybutton torso sprang
Jon heard nothing seen nothing He turning around help Dave onto log feeling responsible safety next thing knew water He tried reach left arm could make move He could move leg He felt bolt pain spine
Jon later described flashing idiosyncratic sequence thought millisecond watching deck card fanning across table One image wheelchair sitting behind mixing console fancy recording studio I guess I become recording engineer wheelchair remembered thinking He never worked recording studio though played music particular plan Still vision apparently felt like acceptable future freed resurface present That registered screaming name
Jon told shouldnt move He knew many wilderness firstresponder training moving person spinal injury risk paralysis Then also knew body submerged cold water recognized risked dying hypothermia didnt move If Im already paralyzed concluded I may well move
He somehow hoisted stream Dave I got using right arm chin biting something loamy teeth additional leverage He reassessed situation better Also worse He realized least mile inland camp
Suddenly body walking leg started working Dave I put u supporting frame He moving faster expected uncoordinatedly Then crumpled u We tried Jon dead weight Dave noticed breathing shallow voice low sign Dave knew med school collapsed lung He began battering Jon pep talk telling firmly get get Jon didnt need explained cogent still trying plot next step mind He looked see log resting lumpy realized fact sitting left arm The arm slack obviously broken sleeve pierced devil club Jon zero feeling He found amusing sensation complete estrangement one limb
Jon stressing important stay together But another theory wilderness survival appeared breaking practice Someone would get radio back camp By chance marooned tent rainstorm night Jon showed u use device though almost formality handheld VHF unit merely lineofsight radio told u meaning range small signal weak pas obstacle You unlikely reach anyone couldnt see hadnt seen anyone since faraway fishing boat early Day 1
There moment discussion maybe exchange look Dave I told Dave go I didnt trust find way back I also knew I lacked courage try whether I sensible cowardly I still dont know Besides I took granted Dave would make He capable mind le likely cinch indecisive knot
Recently though Dave told You probably idea much head I I know growing definitely felt insecure thing I think looked thought Dave everything figured But I much anxiety He brought tremor used hand I knew high school waited table together I occasionally carry Daves soup order wouldnt spill But I guess I thought tremor strictly physiological I couldnt see vulnerability causing
Now Dave sprinted away Jon swatting devil club path rubberized sleeve rain jacket nerve rose rattled He worried wouldnt able find radio got back know turn What broke radio foreclosing whatever marginal chance getting help There lot way screw Dave realized More occurred ran
He found radio He turned Then solved problem encountered another hadnt anticipated What appropriate thing youre supposed say remembered thinking On TV see lot people saying Mayday And Dave faced open water started broadcasting fog Mayday Mayday Even moment though alone beach middle nowhere felt slightly selfconscious This goddamn cliché thought
Back wood kneeling Jon I problem I didnt know say He lying near log injured side beard glass flecked dirt tendril moss He seemed brink losing consciousness At time would possibility Jons dying surface concretely mind Still I knew I supposed keep talking tether world voice somehow
I started vamping platitude We going get soon forth But I could feel treading water even blundering one point longwinded apology worried I overstayed welcome one Christmas family I afraid helplessness voice might counterproductive unsettling Jon instead steadying It tremendous silence fill
What person say I two literature professor college made u memorize poem You never knew line verse would come handy claimed One liked brag traveling Ireland found spat Yeats pub could drink free This I wound reciting love poem Jon

After I imagine I also WH Auden I knew fair amount Auden back The stuff rhyme meter always easiest memorize Looking star I know quite wellThat care I go hell I lot Robert Frost disposal well Stopping Woods Snowy Evening The Road Not Taken For part I trafficked hit
Jon I would spend hour half together alone forest floor I ran everything quiver Kay Ryan AR Ammons Michael Donaghy padding poem little prefatory remark Jon said nothing signaled eye produced sound whenever I checked I felt like radio DJ playing record middle night unsure anyone listening And here one owl Richard Wilbur I would tell Jon would go
I must also done least one Hayden Carruth curmudgeonly pen pal literary magazine Carruths poem didnt lend memorization Id worked hard nail one favorite describes stopping notice deer standing apple thicket realizing northern light flaring overhead Hayden animal pas moment stillness together We proud afraid writes proud sharethe silent magnetic storm destroys star Relative boundless violence deer momentarily allied though still entirely connected glimpse acknowledgmentit enough never enough
Thats I said friend powerlessly tenting jacket face started rain The title poem I Know I Remember But How Can I Help You
The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasnt supposed The 110foot patrol boat normally spent time coursing Gulf Alaska inspecting halibutfishing vessel circulating terrorist deterrent near oil terminal Valdez It homeported Seward hundred mile Glacier Bay But crew transiting Juneau training day earlier smacked storm later poured inland u We gotten absolutely pummeled John Roberts petty officer Mustang told recently For two day boat swished around 15footplus sea Many crew hunkered mess deck vomiting Roberts couple shipmate best cover everyones watch Finally Mustang slipped Glacier Bay find protection The weather started ease That afternoon Roberts piloted Mustang east toward Dundas Bay pallid crewmates finally staggering back bridge asking hell
That Daves Mayday call came The signal Mustangs radio thin faint barely edging range Another ship petty officer Eamon McCormack explained retrospect connection feel mindboggling Glacier Bay National Park extends 5000 square mile Our signal would covered two three mile And yet boat Coast Guard boat le happened passing exceedingly small window precisely right time I dont know nine time 10 play outcome would McCormack said A moment earlier later second potentially might slipped alignment The moving boat would cruised range uncoupling u forever


It 125 pm Mustang received Daves call according one subsequent Coast Guard report Roberts couldnt believe Come man Im tired said aloud wearily receiver front Roberts waited moment per protocol chance Coast Guards central communication center Juneau would pick call instead Then turned asked watch commander pull standardized searchandrescue paperwork He steeling resummoning professionalism I guess said
Roberts crew member Mustang current medical training would complete EMT certification following month As started firing question Dave radio didnt like answer heard coming back shallowness Jons breathing likelihood punctured lung More fundamental Roberts remembered Any time tree fall somebody good He also unsettled learn Dave I lived New York City red flag found someone wind trouble wilderness
We 100 nautical mile nearest hospital halfday trip even ideal condition The Mustang requested Coast Guard Air Station Sitka send helicopter immediate plan Roberts three crewmates peel toward shore ship Zodiac track u Dave found flare Jons emergency kit 220 Zodiac underway Coast Guard asked fire He still front campsite facing water Hed never shot flare He aimed straight watched bright tracer rose arced somewhere far behind deep wood He uncertain whether counted success He started scanning fog front Zodiac never appeared
Someone Mustang caught sight flare near end arc immediately directed crew Zodiac toward steering far away Dave opposite side little peninsula wed camped And yet lucky wound coming ashore much closer I waiting wood Jon Soon whatever poem I reciting interrupted whistle blowing voice calling eventually three shape wearing hard hat heavy orange rain gear rushed toward u tree
Roberts especially impressive reassuringly large Bostonarea native booming voice He knelt took Jons vitals The information troubling pulse 60 beat per minute breathing fast shallow They put neck brace eased onto kind truncated backboard called Miller board move beach Dave returned He I crouched one end board near Jons foot someone presumably Roberts bellowed count three lift
Later night lying sleep bedandbreakfast Gustavus stunned depleted dry warm Dave I would talk talk reviewing entire ordeal We drooped long silence coasting toward sleep Dave spoke one last observation When getting ready lift Jon backboard said occurred one crisis moment hear like mother suddenly able lift car baby Dave expected going superhuman strength
We superhuman strength On Robertss command men raised Jon waist height swiftly seemingly perfectly level though arm deltoid hydraulic Then one motion took downhill negligible help u This cant accurate I remember sensation almost dragged like child sled
A National Geographic television crew embedded Coast Guards air station Sitka filming installment thrillride reality series The network sent crew Coast Guard station around country though assignment appeared hold dramatic potential Air Station Sitka unique Its pilot responsible 12000 mile coastline sprawling treacherous wilderness riven fjord inlet glacier often buffeted implacably horrible weather People went backcountry Alaska way getting different magnitude trouble Roberts put When stuff happens Alaska big Still television crew eighth day Sitka show producer Annabelle Hester explained I call boss headquarters saying Nothing happening We scrambling come Plan B Then Mustangs call came 142
What type injury looking asked dispatcher She taking call behind semicircular counter like reception desk midlevel corporate branch office She framed snapshot parakeet brighten work space photograph dog heart said I Woof You A cameraman stood conspicuously beside holding tense tight shot
Probable broken rib definite broken arm said man end Then voice faltered seemed give And whatever else would happen tree fell added
The dispatcher retrieved appropriate paperwork scribbled Tree fell person one line She read current weather aloud 30 knot wind 300 ceiling heavy rain onemile vi That would soon revised ceiling dropped 100 foot Entering weather condition one Coast Guard incident report someone would write kind nihilistic catchall Extremely terrible
The Coast Guards policy deploy helicopter within 30 minute initial request Air Stations operation officer Cmdr Karl Baldessari informed everyone mission would take longer plan Baldessari 25year veteran Coast Guard fastmoving sinewy man blousy flight suit tidy mustache spiky hair His role air station firehouse chief He responsible safety everyone working meant making judicious decision warranted sending hurtling sky
That calculus got knotty condition like though baseline volatility flying Alaska The Coast Guard didnt let helicopter pilot fly lead Sitka matter much experience air station practiced difficult landing specific location region got ego battered little logging full winter state Visibility Alaska frequently poor condition changed quickly One pilot told blindly tunneling fog dark copilot got caged The man lifted eye momentarily instrument without visual reference horizon latch onto found impossible reorient lost sense direction felled vertigo
During much year also cold enough sufficient moisture air ascending clear region many minor mountain even flying cloud risked aircraft icing To mitigate Coast Guard laid virtual track line across entirety range grid GPS point network path connecting along pilot could chart course fly relatively low altitude confident werent going smash mountain The system wasnt comprehensive track line got pilot close destination ultimately diverge GPS superhighway fly remaining distance oldfashioned way radar eye It like taking exit interstate except might granite wall front wherever chose get It possible pilot would travel far halfmile away whoever needed help discover last leg risky forced turn back
Baldessari gathered two pilot duty afternoon Air Stations flight surgeon unrolled large paper map He pointed location explaining Thats probably one lousiest place fly This Inian Pass right worst place could possibly go
Inian Pass slim channel near center Icy Strait long interconnected system waterway stretching Glacier Bay Conditions Icy Strait bad 300 day year Baldessari recently told wind rain storm surge push fast open ocean But Inian Pass narrow keyhole center strait milewide opening uninhabited island rocky point weather speed The way pilot reach u would fly straight
Nothing National Geographic footage point feel reassuring The flight surgeon hold hand mouth bite lip The copilot Chris Ferguson month posting Alaska mill around fidget ear Its obvious Baldessari need convincing He wasnt eager send men didnt wasnt certain would make way
Its kind funny told pilot pointing map Youve got boat right
Lying backboard like burl driftwood Jon conscious cognizant pain started feel somehow buffered body uninterested connecting world beyond He would later describe thinking blob It passive experience He didnt know happening could tell momentum stalled He confused felt impatient In mind three u solved impossible problem Wed managed get help This supposed simple part everyone rushed hospital Instead condition deteriorated Within 10 minute reaching beach Jon threw Id never seen anything like kind dark purple gristle I took wool cap wipe face retched second time straight hat
I got John Roberts told recently Hed seen vomit like meant Jon ingested fair amount blood signaled internal injury It made Roberts anxious He Mustang two half year point spent previous four year Palm Beach busy le extreme posting often involved rescuing weekend boater relatively close shore Roberts pointed water warm wont necessarily kill go Moreover bulk Coast Guards training maritime rescue rescue land Counterintuitive sound Robertss comfort level confidence dropped significantly hopped Zodiac set foot beach
He reported back Mustang Jon thrown soon radioed explaining Jon going shock He kept giving requesting update trying gauge long might take eventually started erecting makeshift shelter plastic sheeting medical tape hoping keep Jon rain Out earshot u Roberts explained crew mate Eamon McCormack vomit meant The possibility Jon dying care real At one point National Geographic footage Robertss call relayed air station Sitka see dispatcher clearly writes form EMT feel comfortable
By time air station flight surgeon received enough information alarmed It sound like he got pretty significant chest injury told Baldessari Baldessari understood would need launch helicopter warned Mustang aircraft might make weather ultimately would pilot call veered last track line tried shoot Inian Pass
They would go give look Baldessari explained radio outlook iffy The guy beach said must prepared get Jon back cutter haul hospital fast could
One evening winter phone rang Karl Baldessari Long retired Coast Guard teaching aviation community college Oregon I left voice mail message earlier day I meanwhile metamorphosed 40yearold father two fumbled explain Baldessari thrilled I tracked I moment racing finish risotto daughter gymnastics practice would call back Without missing beat Baldessari blared order joking still sounding instinctually charge National Geographic footage OK said want stir constantly slowly
I didnt expect Coast Guardsmen I coldcalling remember day However dramatic remained I assumed would obscured yearslong wash sensational incident But everyone I spoke remember immediately detail Baldessari involved hundred rescue operation 30year career yet I stood stove phone evening told The moment I listened voice mail I knew exactly case It almost like yesterday
There something supreme freakishness accident left lasting impression For came ashore experience also marked feeling subtly escalating chaos pressure surmount McCormack told story retold endlessly often younger Coast Guardsmen eventually tasked training In lesson taking situation look impossible face value said When thing start go wrong dont panic lose sight resource youve got Keep working problem absolute end even McCormack added mean deviating official policy


McCormack supposed landing inflatable boat unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline example But anyway beaching Zodiac gingerly could Roberts men could load Jon aboard They slid side like folder filing cabinet Jon put started motoring chop cautiously back Mustang mile away
As relieved Jon Coast Guard first arrived also felt instantaneously vulnerable Strapped back board neck collar surrendered control body however imperfect control He hauled around object ability wriggle shift position manage pain even turn head see happening He helpless entirely dependent upright people operating around voice could hear discussing far side gauzy divide About 10 minute trip Zodiac Jon heard one voice say Oh shit losing air
A section Zodiacs sponson inflatable fender wrap around boat punctured One side completely deflated Its big deal McCormack recently explained sounding surprised I ask The sponson increase boat buoyancy stability well keeping water cresting side normal condition Zodiac broken sponson would taken service automatically Instead McCormack found puncture wedged nozzle small pump inside Then steering boat one hand operating throttle started working pump foot essentially leg press keep fender partly inflated The ride already bumpy fourfoot sea Now McCormack began tracing slow zigzagging course could tamp turbulence violence Jons spine well guard possibility injured man suddenly bounding side backboard
Roberts Coast Guardsmen Zodiac leaned Jon shield splash The pain heinous Jon seemed passing Roberts talked held hand Roberts felt crushed told torturing guy order save When finally reached Mustang rather hoist Jon Zodiac swung ship crane around simply lifted entire boat water level deck carried aboard keep joggling
McCormack eventually returned Dave halfhour later reunited Jon Mustangs athwartship passageway cramped steel hallway like space two car train Jon still battened backboard wedged keep weight body lesspainful side They cut clothes though hed murmured plea wearing brandnew Patagonia jacket borrowed friend swaddled hypothermia blanket Dave I knelt rubbed foot
The helicopter going make I dont remember grand announcement Im sure ever made aware possibility wouldnt Now crew got busy tying anything could blown rotor wash stashing mess I also dont remember hearing helicopter finally arrived Instead I remember heavy door left swinging open reveal like scene action movie silhouette man blue flight suit foot planted shoulderwidth apart steady ship rocked sideways The cable hed lowered drew back ocean spray fog behind Im flight surgeon Russ Bowman said stepped inside
Bowman took Jons vitals gave several successive shot morphine Soon everyone working squeeze back narrow doorway onto deck helicopter MH60 Jayhawk idling overhead
Until recently story I told accident unfolded two basic act tree fell instantaneously unleashing kind unfathomable chaos Coast Guard appeared swiftly regathered chaos order It like watching footage exploding object watching run reverse The maneuver Coast Guard readying execute deck Mustang would climax progression
The helicopter hovered 30 40 foot boat mirroring speed trajectory vehicle moved slowly forward Looks like youre heading rain squall copilot Chris Ferguson radioed Mustang one point asked ship adjust course keep forgiving weather possible Soon flight mechanic calling instruction tuck aircraft alignment Forward right 30 Forward right 20 Forward right 10 Then finally speaking flight recording almost galling air imperturbability lead helicopter pilot Rich McIntyre radioed flight mechanic begin hoist
The whole procedure vantage point seemed seamless routine In way After agonized deliberation air station pilot exited GPS route fairly manageable condition around Inian Pass The wind workable water wasnt excessively choppy Ultimately scooping Jon deck Mustang would resemble standard exercise pilot drilled training Not dumb copilot Chris Ferguson told plucking someone spinal injury moving boat hoisting moving helicopter pretty insane thing But normalize isnt normal
A moment earlier men scurried around Jon backboard packaging fastening hoist Jon worried second got airborne would start twirling uncontrollably like feathery end cat toy potentially thwack head equipment deck But levitating smoothly solitary swaddled bale man perfectly perpendicular ground Dave I watched happen friend rising steadily away u improbably safety As Jon floated higher could hear Coast Guardsmen Mustang beneath begin cheer He felt safe open eye When saw someone hunched open cargo door helicopter pointing television camera
Jon rushed surgery hospital Sitka evening Hed punctured lung one point collapse sustained multiple fracture eight rib broken several vertebra shattered left shoulder blade snapped brachial plexus nerve His spleen macerated countless fleck After awakening surgery Jon disappointed doctor swept shard bag thrown spleen trash wanted get look maybe even keep preserved jar alongside cyborgbanana
Once back Gustavus Dave I realized would need call Jons parent Switzerland I didnt push job Dave time adamant He felt would need face conversation like going doctor It Jons father picked absorbing news paused caught Dave guard Thank said solemnly You guy saved son life
Daves stomach dropped I remember thinking told recently realizing Yeah I guess logistically I reaction Dave hung phone clearly shaken relayed conversation Until moment idea saved Jons life never occurred u possibly idea Jon might died still hadnt occurred u We zero sense accomplishment even agency In mind avoid screwing real help could arrive save
But Jon hadnt absorbed story way From instant willed water felt u locking seamless flow order steadily displacing chaos Dave I experienced Coast Guard arrived It amazing three u managed generate solution successive problem Even reciting poem always felt like moment utter helplessness became Jons telling perfect emblem streak serendipitous problemsolving You conveyed calmness told recently I remember nice moment He added ever spend two hour dying remote forest floor recite poetry would one top way
The feeling inevitability day became pronounced Jon time passed entire story rescue receded prologue rest life The surgery Sitka first half dozen would take several year regain 60 percent use arm wrist hand nerve gradually regrew along injured side He good enough shape go back Alaska summer accident repairing boat company warehouse occasionally helping bedandbreakfast struggled He could repair kayak needed help lifting He unable wrestle mattress corner fitted sheet made bed After started working recording studio Portland envisioned stuck water run audiomastering company Spleenless Mastering
Eventually Jon seemed recovered accident without conspicuous disability But life quietly corroded chronic pain almost equally stress navigating doctor medication side effect manage About two year accident learned PTSD The trauma wasnt falling tree experience powerlessness perpetual patient American medical system It manifested kind unbearable empathy anyone suffering Jon found shouting doctor behalf also behalf stranger waiting room werent seen He would hear interview naturaldisaster victim homeless NPR pull car There continued tribulation mundane one A time year still rebreaks rib nowhere twice Jon told taken especially affectionate hug wife
Jon found early could cordon suffering mind conversation making joke accident sticking happy ending rescue trick got much easier National Geographic show aired later year Mission Rescue Final Frontier program called The soundtrack heartthwacking synth drum shredding guitar A foreboding Ken Burnseffected snapshot Dave Jon looking joyful trip gave way whirring reenactment someone el leg cast role Daves leg sprinting blurry wood radio A melodramatic narrator pondered fate Kayaker Jon Cohrs
Initially schlockiness production felt like blessing The show depersonalized accident giving u shorthand convey dramatic day without confronting destabilizing senseless might felt At party could lay basic tree fell Jon say National Geographic even made TV special everyone would go wideeyed move figuring would unspool real story time
But never realized degree kitschy shorthand started obscure real story gradually replace Im embarrassed admit though Jon I remained close I know extent continued suffer last 17 year talking several hour order write account
The morning accident Dave I traveled back Dundas Bay pack campsite collect kayak abandoned previous evening We shuttled Gustavus boat captain dropped u three day earlier forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy
The tide cove way arrived Ogilvy put suckass beach The approach shallow drop anchor hundred yard shore He asked wader We So Ogilvy put climbed ladder told Dave get back Then stoically like ox oldtimey strongman hauling safe trudged thighhigh water dropped Dave gravel beach lurched back hauled way I mansize infant papoose
Dave told hed strange feeling ride would discover even massive tree fallen tent since last slept three u would crushed killed wed spent another night Dundas Bay planned That halfexpected find evidence accident fortuitous somehow reason redemptive value behind My mother instinct I called night On phone I strained emphasize two year cruelly premature widowhood I new overprotective son widow Jon going right Dave I safe She told dad must looking u somehow
I resented supernatural thinking If comforted people fine Id somehow known right away I didnt need reason accident It senseless straightforward unequivocal fact father death A tree fell wood It might Jon could died didnt Other possibility spiraled infinitely outward though apparently I wasnt interested contemplating As strange sound year I realized tree could hit friend pointed I told story around fire one night And week ago phone Jon occurred tree could hit three u standing singlefile line waiting cross creek might wound clobbered scattered river dying slowly watching die
Its also probably true I helped preclude possibility feverishly paranoid bear wheeling around sound snapping root Thats allowed see tree coming barely scream infinitesimal headsup Dave And real meaning accident I felt compelled find one might validated exaggerated fear But instead somehow helped cleanse There comfort accepting arbitrariness happened regarding spasm random damage time space randomly small number human being got opportunity repair We capable I understood We also far helpless
On ride back Gustavus gear I pictured small blip empty space The ride rough jumpy Ogilvy impatiently pounded boat last vestigial wave energy storm Dave I hold plant bench behind But moment I felt safe I loosened grip leaned slightly motion boat closing eye felt lift seat

For long history college football local pastime Teams recruited player backyard scheduled game region joined conference based geography If lucky national television twice year
But one team different Notre Dame recruited player nationally religious faith geography defined community The team tidy South Bend Ind playing game New York Texas California almost 100 year The Fighting Irish play No 12 Syracuse 82 Saturday Yankee Stadium familiar haunt nearly century As early 1950s rebroadcast Sundays put Irish television set across country
Notre Dame truly national university said football scholar Michael Oriard played 1960s Once discovered connecting Catholics country saw tremendous advantage embraced
The mediumsize Catholic university claimed 11 national championship Seven player Heisman Trophy
But medium technology turned United States one big neighborhood Starting decade ago business college football changed Soon Fighting Irish different anymore
Today huge recruiting budget private plane social medium make easy team Alabama recruit player California Michigan State play Oregon Oklahoma play Ohio State neutralsite game bring Southern California Arlington Tex Washington Atlanta Big medium deal mean live telecast stream nearly every game ten million household network television cable TV conferenceowned network
Every major program Notre Dame
Alabamas become national recruiting analyst Tom Lemming said Their quarterback Hawaii
That may good college football good Notre Dame The Fighting Irish lost uniqueness decade university competitive advantage Notre Dames last national championship came 1988 That right around college football broadcasting deregulated NCAA longer limiting number time team could appear national television cable television exploded leading present situation team 10 conference play across dozen time slot several national channel
The high school football player today never lived world Notre Dame well Notre Dame
The edge back 60 70 gone college football analyst Phil Steele said They dont brand name kid 18 year old
So No 3 Fighting Irish 100 Coach Brian Kelly two eminently winnable game away berth fourteam College Football Playoff
Notre Dame appears reached point staying distinct universal enough
We work hard maintain national footprint said Jack Swarbrick university athletic director
The defining Notre Dame season came even first Yankee Stadium built In 1913 coach Jesse Harper scheduled game Texas Penn State West Point generating flurry publicity The Irishs win Army major power Hudson River country medium capital huge news
The captain team Knute Rockne became coach continued schedule game far wide Princeton Nebraska Georgia Tech In 1926 put team westbound train begin Notre Dames biggest rivalry Southern California Rockne saw marketer shrewdly exploited emerging mass medium
Sportswriting invented 20 way said James T Fisher professor American study Fordham University Babe Ruth No 1 Notre Dame No 2
Notre Dame stood apart rare Catholic team excelled football Most Catholic college deemphasized sport expensive adopting basketball instead This distinction help explain Notre Dames eclectic scheduling several nearby team refused play The university also doubled football promote Catholic assimilation Protestantdominated culture
It wholesome activity Fisher said Football tailormade allAmerican display Catholic Americanism
Had Notre Dame founded Protestants could never distinguished gridiron way Instead Americas Catholic team monopolized Catholic football player nationally There lengthy chickenoregg debate Notre Dames football success interest football among offspring Italian Polish Irish immigrant

Re Dont Pay College Athletes Cody J McDavis OpEd Feb 26
Wait minute Isnt purpose college provide education Division I sport particularly football basketball corrupted college athletics totally lost sight purpose college Higher education would much better college university followed Division III rule academic scholarship
As Mr McDavis suggests let National Basketball Association developmental league pay aspiring young basketball talent Also let minor league baseball continue pay aspiring young baseball player And organize developmental football league pay aspiring pro football player
The issue whether student paid whether professional sport belong university
Tom BarnardShaker Heights Ohio
To Editor
Cody J McDavis opinion paying athlete play college sport wrong would ruin college sport We already road ruin time
Unfortunately top division college football basketball become predictable point boredom Sure occasional interloper Virginia Commonwealth University George Mason Butler generally team mix sport Think Alabama Clemson football Duke Kentucky North Carolina Michigan basketball
We face fact pay student done romantic notion school spirit amateur competition It money nothing
Some rule rule would keep student school four year would keeping spirit National Collegiate Athletic Association However given level money corruption real change going happen Paying athlete would least small step toward honesty
Gerald BowmanMunich
To Editor
Cody J McDavis say paying college athlete would create arm race select group college program could compete In reality arm race exactly college sport currently function This particularly true major college football basketball program
Colleges build multimilliondollar sport facility attract top recruit And salary coach major football basketball program ballooned recent year What would call arm race Worse yet NCAA cartel prevented player receiving fair compensation winner arm race coach athletic director Unsurprisingly usually first people argue paying player
While arm race governs major college sport select group top program healthy ecosystem exists opportunity midmajor nonscholarship intercollegiate competition I personally grateful opportunity existed I confident similar opportunity would exist even successful college player paid fairly
Compensating top structure value bring ruin college sport It ensure college sport remain something enjoyed many fan student alumnus

Its hard describe thoroughly energized Steves becomes front crowd He pace gesticulates speaks fast He tell favorite old joke eternally new Eet smell like zee foot angel French cheesemonger always exclaims Onstage combination preacher comedian salesman lifehacker professor inspirational speaker Steves told u day pack entire life single bag measuring 9 22 14 inch Its enlightened pack light Steves insists Its blessing pack light He told u find excellent cheap hotel survive minimalist picnic public park wash clothing bathroom sink make friend without sharing language Stevess signature book Europe Through Back Door seemed le like travel philosophy whole mode scrappy prepared independent extroverted Europes front door told u positioned feed traveler directly exploitation overpriced cafe trinket shop long line corporate highrise hotel The back door contrast led revelation He showed u impossibly enticing photo cobblestone piazza teeming fruit stall quirky wooden hotel among wildflower Alps vast arsenal multicolored cheese He made travel seem le like luxury necessary exploration self civic responsibility basic courtesy fellow human It seemed almost unreasonable go Above Steves told u afraid The people world wonderful planet share spectacular But way really understand go see So go
My girlfriend I left room convert gospel Rick Steves We bought book highlighted nearmeaninglessness We started mapping itinerary squirreling away money asking relative donation In probably worst phone call life rancher grandfather expressed shock dismay I would ask support meaningless overseas lark Eventually many month scraped together enough buy plane ticket order minimalist Stevesapproved supply including travel towel thin nonabsorbent seemed push moisture around skin forgot wet We packed exactly Steves taught u Tshirts rolled spacesaving noodle enough clothes get u one hotel laundry session next Then first time life left North America
One Stevess strongest recommendation keep journal Mine corny cover actually said A TRAVELERS NOTEBOOK picture Eiffel Tower When I opened recently reality longago trip hissed fresh urgency My 20yearold self recorded everything On first day Europe bought imported Austrian apple fat heavy English coin saw woman stumble staircase breaking entire bag newly bought china We arrived first hostel YMCA Bath find man urinating stairwell kept walking happened nearby churchyard gravestone old thin almost translucent As tried make name dead songbird sang strenuously tree around u This juxtaposition old death new life blew jetlagged American mind Already one day Bath I wrote journal world grown firmer Reality fill gap
That le theme trip For six week followed Steves game plan We shared squalid bunk young traveler Denmark Australia Canada Japan In stately public park Paris ate rotisserie chicken bare hand One stifling afternoon Colosseum Rome watched worker slam ladder edge arch break ancient brick He looked u looked brick kicked dirt kept working We moved Van Gogh Picasso Gaudí unmoved Versailles vain beautiful I wrote bullfighting brutal artful Goya vague blurry Once I left underwear Mediterranean beach overnight since I could afford lose pair go back pick next day full view sunbather
Wherever went Rick Steves u In journal I referred halfjokingly worldly uncle guiding light walked around I annoyed girlfriend impression We seemed entered world slide fruit market overnight train sunny French river ancient Roman aqueduct Sometimes European host quiet pride someone met Elvis told u story Steves He gentleman said truly good man always came person check hotel never failed ask child
By end trip completely broke We couldnt afford even baguette last day Paris We flew home looking ragged shaggy weatherbeaten exhausted


But course Steves right Our life never We still young Americans felt liberated empowered like true citizen world The important thing learned home As English writer GK Chesterton put quote I found printed corny old travel journal The whole object travel set foot foreign land last set foot one country foreign land After looking Roman stone wall topped Saxon stone wall topped medieval English wall next modern paved street I began see thin crust national history United States actually stand I began realize silly narrow notion exceptionalism impulse consider somehow immune force shape rest world The environment I grew mall freeway fantasy heroic individualism began seem unnatural I started sense much reality exists elsewhere world theoretical sense book movie full urgent weight real And Europe every continent time forever I began realize much I still learn I could pretend understand anything Not everyone need Stevess help get point Some people get community help But I needed I eternally glad I dragged day see talk
How eat Venice like Venetian
Steves answered front door slightly distracted I come middle breakfast preparation He stirring block frozen orange juice pitcher water Freshly squeezed quipped This April 2018 exactly 20 year first trip Europe I come see Steves exotic place possible home He life north Seattle town rainy free umbrellashare program There nothing particularly exotic house It beige carpeting professionally trimmed shrub back deck hot tub What exotic simply Steves He returned frenetic speaking tour United States would leaving almost immediately annual trip Europe For making breakfast frozen blueberry Kashi cereal OJ I would eat every day rest life I could said
But course could Steves gone much yoyoing misty forest Pacific Northwest sunbaked cathedral Europe Every year matter else going Steves spends least four month practicing kind travel preached 40odd year hauling backpack narrow staircase cheap hotel washing clothes sink improvising picnic
He 63 could afford retire many time But doesnt metabolism sitting around Among colleague Steves notorious workaholic After grueling day filming Europe known slip script revision crew door 2 ask breakfast feedback On long car ride sits back seat type opeds laptop His relentless handson control every aspect business distinguished Rick Steves brand
It also obviously exhausting Steves least people around He two child grown much childhood Steves gone He building company changing world For long stretch wife forced single mother She Steves divorced 2010 25 year marriage Every summer family joined Steves Europe pace hardly slackened They would cover major city 48 hour blitzing huge museum back back The kid complained much one trip Steves finally snapped miserable said could go sit hotel room day play video game They remember day heaven One year Steves away child converted Catholicism His son Andy Steves eventually went family business He work tour guide even published European guidebook
Steves fully aware obsessive work ethic unusual He admits regret But make stop He fervor true evangelist The people meet city visit life might change At one point talked pulled itinerary coming trip Sicily Iceland time whatsoever Just looking made giddy I asked couldnt ease slightly maybe spend two month Europe maybe speak 10 American city
Its strange thing said I get energy Its like Im breathing straight oxygen What would I I stayed home Not much Nothing I would remember
In house Steves offered little show tell He pointed antique silver cigarette lighter shaped like Space Needle He sat baby grand piano lost happy minute playing Scarlatti He took room filled book reached high shelf I dont show many people said theyll think Im nut Steves pulled thick red binder content indeed pretty nutty When Steves 13 decided apparent reason conduct deep statistical analysis 1968 Billboard pop chart Every week would clip ranking local newspaper using point system devising graph top band success sheet gridded paper The line multicolored interwoven looked like subway map fantastical foreign city You could see glance rising falling fortune Beatles red Creedence Clearwater Revival black Elvis Presley dot dash Steves kept three year taping together many piece graph paper end summarized data authoritativelooking table typed family typewriter This binder systematic breakdown successful band 1968 1970 determined objective statistic analytical adolescent weirdo The winner course Beatles 1739 point followed Creedence Simon Garfunkel Neil Diamond
Steves laughed It ridiculous But also perfect window mind Even 13 powerful energy coiled inside unusual combination obsession precision waiting worthwhile project burst
And coincidentally exactly found project life In summer 1969 Steves 14 parent took Europe They owned business tuning importing piano wanted see factory firsthand Steves approached first trip abroad meticulous energy brought Billboard graph As traveled around continent recorded essential data journey back postcard location activity weather expense One day Steves spent 40 cent fishing gear Another met 79yearold man witnessed assassination Archduke Franz Ferdinand To keep everything order Steves numbered postcard sequentially He still packed lovingly old wooden box
On formative trip Steves family visited relative Norway They happened July 1969 Neil Armstrong walked moon Ett lite skritt et menneske television said ett stort sprang menneskeheten In moment strange place young Rick Steves felt concept menneskeheten mankind depth never would able access back home Europe crash course cultural relativity In park Oslo epiphany The foreign human around realized leading existence every bit rich full Right would write later 14yearold egocentric worldview took huge hit A lifechanging realization clicked place This planet must home billion equally lovable child God
That first trip set course everything followed When Steves 18 went back Europe without parent Soon life America became series interlude travel He taught piano earn money stretched money far possibly could sleeping church pew park bench empty barn construction zone Western Europe Afghanistan He turned cheapness science Instead paying hotel room city Steves would use Railpass sleep train night four hour four hour back He would stuff free breakfast bread try eat little possible rest day Naturally recorded today impressive archive old travel journal Their page preserve tiny handwriting shadowy young dissident Moscow diarrhea Bulgaria revolution Nicaragua

This balancing act become increasingly difficult past two decade world terrorism war nationalism metastasizing partisanship After Sept 11 attack travel company anticipated bottom fall market They canceled tour cut back budget Steves however remained defiantly optimistic He promised staff would cut layoff shift message He insisted world crisis needed travel le Soon shock Sept 11 turned Iraq war strained relationship United States even closest European ally sending travel industry deeper trough In hometown Steves caused controversy walked around removing row American flag set support war It argued act patriotism The flag meant represent Americans war supporter I sharkbait Seattles rightwing radio talk show several day wrote
Lately Steves concedes political message begun take teaching In Travel Political Act familiar element guidebook walking tour museum guide hotel review replaced rabblerousing cultural critique Steves express deep admiration Scandinavianstyle social democracy call many Americas fault addiction car gun mass incarceration deference corporation long history cultural imperialism one ugliest thing one nation write another nation textbook Some moment book verge unAmerican Sometimes Im frustrated impact American foreign policy developing world Steves writes I feeling impotent America better world America whose power isnt always used good

The whale sighting happened right away minute Day 1 Jon Dave I dropped remote Alaskan shoreline hour half boat closest speck town Jon working seakayaking guide summer Glacier Bay National Park invited u sevenday excursion week As boat delivered u vanished drone engine dampening murmur finally trailing became unthinkably quiet beach largeness strangeness surroundings suddenly apparent It familiar phenomenon Jon start trip moment people instinctually paused soak To felt like scene astronaut finally rattled free earth atmosphere slip stillness space Except werent space We earth finally really earth
We starting move around packing gear kayak heard first huff blowhole far offshore
Jon ecstatic It seemed animal putting show swimming playfully kelp diving resurfacing plowing open mouth across surface feed He took good omen Though I idea time anxious Dave I might feel intimidated making trip big payoff quickly would get u excited defuse apprehension
For Dave whalesighting exactly opposite effect Once kid dad took scuba diving dolphin They friendly aweinspiring creature purportedly terrified Dave instead He could still conjure feeling hanging defenselessly water animal deftly swirled around le like solid object flash reflected light could move comparative slowmotion Ever since harbored fear large sea creature niche phobia particularly young man lived Bronx genuine one still And even Dave understood chance see whale close like major draw kayaking trip Alaska though feigned thrilled second thought kicking We going realized
The whale left exhilarated gleeful like Jon deeper I also remember feeling shaken like Dave Nothing animal registered playful welcoming It appeared distance transited quickly past u left right My uneasiness something whale great size indifference obliviousness passed Watching made feel profoundly place register large wilderness relative
At time I working literary magazine New York City called The Hudson Review picking poem slush pile mailing outside panel editorial adviser I trying hard letter impress one Hayden Carruth gruff irreverent 81yearold poet lived far upstate I loved Carruths work enamored persona yeoman life wood intolerance phoniness precision articulated common suffering including one strain suffering I related particularly year wouldnt courage clarity examine
I always aware Carruth wrote youth Universe sad everything animate inanimate wild creature stone star enveloped great sadness pervaded Never I able look cloudless sky night see beauty A kind grandeur yes beauty The profusion variety celestial light always frightened Why Why instead others Why instead nothing
That I felt watching whale beach afraid everything accident Then maybe hard picture start trip retrospect without amplifying feeling foreboding Something else Carruth wrote always stuck The wilderness begin edge body edge consciousness extends edge universe filled menace

It midAugust 2002 23 24 25 We graduated college together two year earlier Dave I also grew shot undergrad knowing wanted doctor finished first year medical school Any similar momentum I graduation instantly sapped Three night I returned parent house school I found driving father emergency room Three week died My grief disorienting total moment life everything supposed feel possible making single decision became impossible I gave sadness better part year resettling home New Jersey widowed mother sliding back summer job I worked school glumly breaking beef butcher shop two town
I coped fatherlessness confusion way Im proud still dont understand I read lot book Ronald Reagan example even collection love letter Nancy I also lashed Dave living home summer studying MCAT He withdrew awkwardly funeral I suppose I happy hold It triggered longstanding jealousy A part always resented seemed unfairly exempt selfdoubt heaviness I prone
Jon meanwhile teaching rustic little boarding school Switzerland mother The summer graduation starting job set Alaska friend sleeping bed old pickup In minuscule town Gustavus gateway Glacier Bay picked seasonal work warehouse kayaktour company Jon little actual experience sea kayaking always felt drawn ocean abstract In college another friend plotted paddling expedition near Glacier Bay across border Canada applied grant school fund The grant set memory alumnus died avalanche mountaineering It meant encourage responsible conscientious pursuit wilderness expedition Safety key But committee rejected Jon partner application They seemed insufficiently prepared
That wasnt surprising Jon grew lot backcountry camping competent outdoorsman putting together grant application required kind administrative fastidiousness didnt always posse He bright scatterbrained forever picking thing putting figuratively music project conversation also literally I still picture hustling around house shared college hunting key soldering iron gotten head rewiring device He artist one piece I remember consisted halfpeeled banana implanted circuitry suspended jar formaldehyde Once grew grass upstairs bathroom living bathmat said turf became muddy flooded downstairs
This Jons third summer Alaska hed worked way leading expedition taking vacationer day time Our trip however would venture beyond typical circuit remote corner park hed never Jon serious concern safety felt bore responsibility emotional wellbeing To enjoy would need feel comfortable wilderness also leader
He suspected wouldnt trust entirely We didnt We knew became professional guide perception expertise lagged behind reality With Jon Dave told always unclear extent hed thought everything Dave remembered landing Gustavus night got underway casually asking Jon lot question Where going exactly Do everything need Jon seemed solid answer As headed back place good night sleep told u wait yard He living alone summer house acquaintance building wood The structure framedup largely wallless Jon safe needed check moose wandered
After spectacular first day paddling came ashore rocky tidal flat two mile dropped Jon gave u detailed tutorial bear safety set campsite He taught u example holler Hey bear heard rustling also preventively ahead u walked wood The last thing wanted come across brown bear unannounced
Hey bear Jon kept hollering way demonstration He said goofily like childrens TV host greeting downonhisluck ursine neighbor doorway clubhouse This intentional Jon noticed people trip often resisted bellowing Hey bear wilderness It essential safety felt silly vulnerable somehow like singing public So learned turn shtick spinning streamofconsciousness narration Hey bear Im coming tree Hope youre fantastic evening Mr Bear It loosened everyone They performing friend whole group joke
I never seen wild bear though I backpacked bear country handful time I felt comfortable animal abstract But bear werent abstract breached material plane There bear trail everywhere leading tree line water disquietingly close I felt pitching tent We found heap scat We saw tree animal slashed bark eat inner layer tuft fur paw still plastered sap
I pretended I fun But evening I grew increasingly petrified almost delirious My eye tightened scanning bear The sound wind became bear mossy stick cracking foot I gave migraine phased sleep
At sunrise I woke feeling foolish While Jon cooked pancake I reasoned privately notebook I brought trip I tried conceive situation geometry problem Yes number bear roved landscape I wrote relatively tiny independent blip going business randomly like u In empty space confusion lethal collision moving blip moving blip would improbable coincidence Id distorting odds mistaking absolute focus bear attention I wrote It embarrassing really To afraid bear I concluded narcissistic
I reminding freakishly horrible thing definition unlikely happen Even reasoning feel sound

Day 2 slog We paddled spitting drizzle endless straight line along high granite wall coast We talked le le pushed emerald chop Then eventually gave hauling boat making camp wide crescentshaped cove short site Jon originally picked map
We entered Dundas Bay rarely visited pocket national park Ive since learned storied history hideout solitary misanthrope In 1930s one prospector built cabin far campsite brandished gun Alaska Natives passed
We intuited scenery beautiful could see little fog Our guidebook explained east side bay get extremely rough foul weather since large wave roll batter shoreline That happening The weather plinked u afternoon roiling storm Soon big rain started We rushed dinner loafed tent eventually loafing turned sleep
A local newspaper would later describe storm short intense In Gustavus creek swelled foot higher previous record Gale wind gust 59 mile per hour turned back two cruise ship Skagway 85 mile north Around 2 woke discover wind shorn rain fly tent Jons sleeping bag mine soaked Dave snug dry u We heard torrent water lashing wave crashing cove
We got three four hour later The rain wind longer felt ferocious still gnarly paddle question Jon said staying put We cooked breakfast took turn playing chess tent By late morning storm seemed passed We antsy We figured would take look around
The terrain crammed thicket alder spruce underlain fern furor prickly thing Jon pointed devil club three four foot tall leafy armored spine The plant pierced fleece hurt like fire
There trail Wed trudging time reached fastmoving stream maybe 10 foot wide Jon surprised wasnt map likely drainage bloated storm We followed downstream looking way across eventually found bridged hefty tree trunk It seemed like easy crossing Jon stepped led way Dave I waited singlefile line stream bank behind The creek loud like factory gear roller churning Looking Jon realized water hed thought
Thats I heard snap wood behind After paranoia I instantly understood many bear Id thought I heard absolutely bear nothing sound unmistakable crisp explicitly something I turned hollered Hey bear waited beat Maybe I said Hey bear Im sure But I must scanned tree long enough feel satisfied safe I know I turning head go back friend I saw dark shape rushing forward peripheral vision
What I heard must root popping If tree large enough apparently hear cracking underground like gunfire
The thud seismic The trunk crashed right next Mapping bit evidence later concluded tree must 80 foot tall perhaps two foot diameter It kind conifer spruce cedar I screamed involuntarily Look watched Dave step directly front dive sideways hit ground When I got crouching stunned OK He looked said Go get Jon
It hadnt clicked back There three u The sight Dave going canceled everything else I scrambled creek running across tree fallen shouting Jons name spotted water tangled snarl shearedoff branch near bank behind cage kept hurtling downstream
He know hed hit falling tree It narrowly missed head struck left shoulder shearing collarbone breaking many rib Later doctor would explain downward force powerful probably squashed Jons entire upper body organ inside toward waist momentarily compressing like bellow split second shoulder headed direction bellybutton torso sprang
Jon heard nothing seen nothing He turning around help Dave onto log feeling responsible safety next thing knew water He tried reach left arm could make move He could move leg He felt bolt pain spine
Jon later described flashing idiosyncratic sequence thought millisecond watching deck card fanning across table One image wheelchair sitting behind mixing console fancy recording studio I guess I become recording engineer wheelchair remembered thinking He never worked recording studio though played music particular plan Still vision apparently felt like acceptable future freed resurface present That registered screaming name
Jon told shouldnt move He knew many wilderness firstresponder training moving person spinal injury risk paralysis Then also knew body submerged cold water recognized risked dying hypothermia didnt move If Im already paralyzed concluded I may well move
He somehow hoisted stream Dave I got using right arm chin biting something loamy teeth additional leverage He reassessed situation better Also worse He realized least mile inland camp
Suddenly body walking leg started working Dave I put u supporting frame He moving faster expected uncoordinatedly Then crumpled u We tried Jon dead weight Dave noticed breathing shallow voice low sign Dave knew med school collapsed lung He began battering Jon pep talk telling firmly get get Jon didnt need explained cogent still trying plot next step mind He looked see log resting lumpy realized fact sitting left arm The arm slack obviously broken sleeve pierced devil club Jon zero feeling He found amusing sensation complete estrangement one limb
Jon stressing important stay together But another theory wilderness survival appeared breaking practice Someone would get radio back camp By chance marooned tent rainstorm night Jon showed u use device though almost formality handheld VHF unit merely lineofsight radio told u meaning range small signal weak pas obstacle You unlikely reach anyone couldnt see hadnt seen anyone since faraway fishing boat early Day 1
There moment discussion maybe exchange look Dave I told Dave go I didnt trust find way back I also knew I lacked courage try whether I sensible cowardly I still dont know Besides I took granted Dave would make He capable mind le likely cinch indecisive knot
Recently though Dave told You probably idea much head I I know growing definitely felt insecure thing I think looked thought Dave everything figured But I much anxiety He brought tremor used hand I knew high school waited table together I occasionally carry Daves soup order wouldnt spill But I guess I thought tremor strictly physiological I couldnt see vulnerability causing
Now Dave sprinted away Jon swatting devil club path rubberized sleeve rain jacket nerve rose rattled He worried wouldnt able find radio got back know turn What broke radio foreclosing whatever marginal chance getting help There lot way screw Dave realized More occurred ran
He found radio He turned Then solved problem encountered another hadnt anticipated What appropriate thing youre supposed say remembered thinking On TV see lot people saying Mayday And Dave faced open water started broadcasting fog Mayday Mayday Even moment though alone beach middle nowhere felt slightly selfconscious This goddamn cliché thought
Back wood kneeling Jon I problem I didnt know say He lying near log injured side beard glass flecked dirt tendril moss He seemed brink losing consciousness At time would possibility Jons dying surface concretely mind Still I knew I supposed keep talking tether world voice somehow
I started vamping platitude We going get soon forth But I could feel treading water even blundering one point longwinded apology worried I overstayed welcome one Christmas family I afraid helplessness voice might counterproductive unsettling Jon instead steadying It tremendous silence fill
What person say I two literature professor college made u memorize poem You never knew line verse would come handy claimed One liked brag traveling Ireland found spat Yeats pub could drink free This I wound reciting love poem Jon

The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasnt supposed The 110foot patrol boat normally spent time coursing Gulf Alaska inspecting halibutfishing vessel circulating terrorist deterrent near oil terminal Valdez It homeported Seward hundred mile Glacier Bay But crew transiting Juneau training day earlier smacked storm later poured inland u We gotten absolutely pummeled John Roberts petty officer Mustang told recently For two day boat swished around 15footplus sea Many crew hunkered mess deck vomiting Roberts couple shipmate best cover everyones watch Finally Mustang slipped Glacier Bay find protection The weather started ease That afternoon Roberts piloted Mustang east toward Dundas Bay pallid crewmates finally staggering back bridge asking hell
That Daves Mayday call came The signal Mustangs radio thin faint barely edging range Another ship petty officer Eamon McCormack explained retrospect connection feel mindboggling Glacier Bay National Park extends 5000 square mile Our signal would covered two three mile And yet boat Coast Guard boat le happened passing exceedingly small window precisely right time I dont know nine time 10 play outcome would McCormack said A moment earlier later second potentially might slipped alignment The moving boat would cruised range uncoupling u forever


It 125 pm Mustang received Daves call according one subsequent Coast Guard report Roberts couldnt believe Come man Im tired said aloud wearily receiver front Roberts waited moment per protocol chance Coast Guards central communication center Juneau would pick call instead Then turned asked watch commander pull standardized searchandrescue paperwork He steeling resummoning professionalism I guess said
Roberts crew member Mustang current medical training would complete EMT certification following month As started firing question Dave radio didnt like answer heard coming back shallowness Jons breathing likelihood punctured lung More fundamental Roberts remembered Any time tree fall somebody good He also unsettled learn Dave I lived New York City red flag found someone wind trouble wilderness
We 100 nautical mile nearest hospital halfday trip even ideal condition The Mustang requested Coast Guard Air Station Sitka send helicopter immediate plan Roberts three crewmates peel toward shore ship Zodiac track u Dave found flare Jons emergency kit 220 Zodiac underway Coast Guard asked fire He still front campsite facing water Hed never shot flare He aimed straight watched bright tracer rose arced somewhere far behind deep wood He uncertain whether counted success He started scanning fog front Zodiac never appeared
Someone Mustang caught sight flare near end arc immediately directed crew Zodiac toward steering far away Dave opposite side little peninsula wed camped And yet lucky wound coming ashore much closer I waiting wood Jon Soon whatever poem I reciting interrupted whistle blowing voice calling eventually three shape wearing hard hat heavy orange rain gear rushed toward u tree
Roberts especially impressive reassuringly large Bostonarea native booming voice He knelt took Jons vitals The information troubling pulse 60 beat per minute breathing fast shallow They put neck brace eased onto kind truncated backboard called Miller board move beach Dave returned He I crouched one end board near Jons foot someone presumably Roberts bellowed count three lift
Later night lying sleep bedandbreakfast Gustavus stunned depleted dry warm Dave I would talk talk reviewing entire ordeal We drooped long silence coasting toward sleep Dave spoke one last observation When getting ready lift Jon backboard said occurred one crisis moment hear like mother suddenly able lift car baby Dave expected going superhuman strength
We superhuman strength On Robertss command men raised Jon waist height swiftly seemingly perfectly level though arm deltoid hydraulic Then one motion took downhill negligible help u This cant accurate I remember sensation almost dragged like child sled
A National Geographic television crew embedded Coast Guards air station Sitka filming installment thrillride reality series The network sent crew Coast Guard station around country though assignment appeared hold dramatic potential Air Station Sitka unique Its pilot responsible 12000 mile coastline sprawling treacherous wilderness riven fjord inlet glacier often buffeted implacably horrible weather People went backcountry Alaska way getting different magnitude trouble Roberts put When stuff happens Alaska big Still television crew eighth day Sitka show producer Annabelle Hester explained I call boss headquarters saying Nothing happening We scrambling come Plan B Then Mustangs call came 142
What type injury looking asked dispatcher She taking call behind semicircular counter like reception desk midlevel corporate branch office She framed snapshot parakeet brighten work space photograph dog heart said I Woof You A cameraman stood conspicuously beside holding tense tight shot
Probable broken rib definite broken arm said man end Then voice faltered seemed give And whatever else would happen tree fell added
The dispatcher retrieved appropriate paperwork scribbled Tree fell person one line She read current weather aloud 30 knot wind 300 ceiling heavy rain onemile vi That would soon revised ceiling dropped 100 foot Entering weather condition one Coast Guard incident report someone would write kind nihilistic catchall Extremely terrible
The Coast Guards policy deploy helicopter within 30 minute initial request Air Stations operation officer Cmdr Karl Baldessari informed everyone mission would take longer plan Baldessari 25year veteran Coast Guard fastmoving sinewy man blousy flight suit tidy mustache spiky hair His role air station firehouse chief He responsible safety everyone working meant making judicious decision warranted sending hurtling sky
That calculus got knotty condition like though baseline volatility flying Alaska The Coast Guard didnt let helicopter pilot fly lead Sitka matter much experience air station practiced difficult landing specific location region got ego battered little logging full winter state Visibility Alaska frequently poor condition changed quickly One pilot told blindly tunneling fog dark copilot got caged The man lifted eye momentarily instrument without visual reference horizon latch onto found impossible reorient lost sense direction felled vertigo
During much year also cold enough sufficient moisture air ascending clear region many minor mountain even flying cloud risked aircraft icing To mitigate Coast Guard laid virtual track line across entirety range grid GPS point network path connecting along pilot could chart course fly relatively low altitude confident werent going smash mountain The system wasnt comprehensive track line got pilot close destination ultimately diverge GPS superhighway fly remaining distance oldfashioned way radar eye It like taking exit interstate except might granite wall front wherever chose get It possible pilot would travel far halfmile away whoever needed help discover last leg risky forced turn back
Baldessari gathered two pilot duty afternoon Air Stations flight surgeon unrolled large paper map He pointed location explaining Thats probably one lousiest place fly This Inian Pass right worst place could possibly go
Inian Pass slim channel near center Icy Strait long interconnected system waterway stretching Glacier Bay Conditions Icy Strait bad 300 day year Baldessari recently told wind rain storm surge push fast open ocean But Inian Pass narrow keyhole center strait milewide opening uninhabited island rocky point weather speed The way pilot reach u would fly straight
Nothing National Geographic footage point feel reassuring The flight surgeon hold hand mouth bite lip The copilot Chris Ferguson month posting Alaska mill around fidget ear Its obvious Baldessari need convincing He wasnt eager send men didnt wasnt certain would make way
Its kind funny told pilot pointing map Youve got boat right
Lying backboard like burl driftwood Jon conscious cognizant pain started feel somehow buffered body uninterested connecting world beyond He would later describe thinking blob It passive experience He didnt know happening could tell momentum stalled He confused felt impatient In mind three u solved impossible problem Wed managed get help This supposed simple part everyone rushed hospital Instead condition deteriorated Within 10 minute reaching beach Jon threw Id never seen anything like kind dark purple gristle I took wool cap wipe face retched second time straight hat
I got John Roberts told recently Hed seen vomit like meant Jon ingested fair amount blood signaled internal injury It made Roberts anxious He Mustang two half year point spent previous four year Palm Beach busy le extreme posting often involved rescuing weekend boater relatively close shore Roberts pointed water warm wont necessarily kill go Moreover bulk Coast Guards training maritime rescue rescue land Counterintuitive sound Robertss comfort level confidence dropped significantly hopped Zodiac set foot beach
He reported back Mustang Jon thrown soon radioed explaining Jon going shock He kept giving requesting update trying gauge long might take eventually started erecting makeshift shelter plastic sheeting medical tape hoping keep Jon rain Out earshot u Roberts explained crew mate Eamon McCormack vomit meant The possibility Jon dying care real At one point National Geographic footage Robertss call relayed air station Sitka see dispatcher clearly writes form EMT feel comfortable
By time air station flight surgeon received enough information alarmed It sound like he got pretty significant chest injury told Baldessari Baldessari understood would need launch helicopter warned Mustang aircraft might make weather ultimately would pilot call veered last track line tried shoot Inian Pass
They would go give look Baldessari explained radio outlook iffy The guy beach said must prepared get Jon back cutter haul hospital fast could
One evening winter phone rang Karl Baldessari Long retired Coast Guard teaching aviation community college Oregon I left voice mail message earlier day I meanwhile metamorphosed 40yearold father two fumbled explain Baldessari thrilled I tracked I moment racing finish risotto daughter gymnastics practice would call back Without missing beat Baldessari blared order joking still sounding instinctually charge National Geographic footage OK said want stir constantly slowly
I didnt expect Coast Guardsmen I coldcalling remember day However dramatic remained I assumed would obscured yearslong wash sensational incident But everyone I spoke remember immediately detail Baldessari involved hundred rescue operation 30year career yet I stood stove phone evening told The moment I listened voice mail I knew exactly case It almost like yesterday
There something supreme freakishness accident left lasting impression For came ashore experience also marked feeling subtly escalating chaos pressure surmount McCormack told story retold endlessly often younger Coast Guardsmen eventually tasked training In lesson taking situation look impossible face value said When thing start go wrong dont panic lose sight resource youve got Keep working problem absolute end even McCormack added mean deviating official policy


McCormack supposed landing inflatable boat unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline example But anyway beaching Zodiac gingerly could Roberts men could load Jon aboard They slid side like folder filing cabinet Jon put started motoring chop cautiously back Mustang mile away
As relieved Jon Coast Guard first arrived also felt instantaneously vulnerable Strapped back board neck collar surrendered control body however imperfect control He hauled around object ability wriggle shift position manage pain even turn head see happening He helpless entirely dependent upright people operating around voice could hear discussing far side gauzy divide About 10 minute trip Zodiac Jon heard one voice say Oh shit losing air
A section Zodiacs sponson inflatable fender wrap around boat punctured One side completely deflated Its big deal McCormack recently explained sounding surprised I ask The sponson increase boat buoyancy stability well keeping water cresting side normal condition Zodiac broken sponson would taken service automatically Instead McCormack found puncture wedged nozzle small pump inside Then steering boat one hand operating throttle started working pump foot essentially leg press keep fender partly inflated The ride already bumpy fourfoot sea Now McCormack began tracing slow zigzagging course could tamp turbulence violence Jons spine well guard possibility injured man suddenly bounding side backboard
Roberts Coast Guardsmen Zodiac leaned Jon shield splash The pain heinous Jon seemed passing Roberts talked held hand Roberts felt crushed told torturing guy order save When finally reached Mustang rather hoist Jon Zodiac swung ship crane around simply lifted entire boat water level deck carried aboard keep joggling
McCormack eventually returned Dave halfhour later reunited Jon Mustangs athwartship passageway cramped steel hallway like space two car train Jon still battened backboard wedged keep weight body lesspainful side They cut clothes though hed murmured plea wearing brandnew Patagonia jacket borrowed friend swaddled hypothermia blanket Dave I knelt rubbed foot
The helicopter going make I dont remember grand announcement Im sure ever made aware possibility wouldnt Now crew got busy tying anything could blown rotor wash stashing mess I also dont remember hearing helicopter finally arrived Instead I remember heavy door left swinging open reveal like scene action movie silhouette man blue flight suit foot planted shoulderwidth apart steady ship rocked sideways The cable hed lowered drew back ocean spray fog behind Im flight surgeon Russ Bowman said stepped inside

Until recently story I told accident unfolded two basic act tree fell instantaneously unleashing kind unfathomable chaos Coast Guard appeared swiftly regathered chaos order It like watching footage exploding object watching run reverse The maneuver Coast Guard readying execute deck Mustang would climax progression
The helicopter hovered 30 40 foot boat mirroring speed trajectory vehicle moved slowly forward Looks like youre heading rain squall copilot Chris Ferguson radioed Mustang one point asked ship adjust course keep forgiving weather possible Soon flight mechanic calling instruction tuck aircraft alignment Forward right 30 Forward right 20 Forward right 10 Then finally speaking flight recording almost galling air imperturbability lead helicopter pilot Rich McIntyre radioed flight mechanic begin hoist

I felt working together thats I sort caught guard actual complaint Mr Booker said We share goal ultimately
He pointed many public safety reform instituting went beyond police department senior citizen group working police policeclergy alliance change making court system

Its definitely fair say filing ACLU petition Justice Department concluded investigation something clicked said Mr Ofer ACLUs deputy national political director I dont know persuaded petition
As Mr Booker tell book another factor chief staff Modia Butler sat mayor office told grown blind constituent complaint
If I stepped crimefighting bubble another young black guy I would embrace comprehensive investigation Id demanding Mr Booker recalled Mr Butler telling The message punctuated blunt assessment I head large black posterior region
Mr Butler also sold potential Justice Department intervention blessing million dollar worth free consulting underfunded department laid 13 percent force
As digested ACLU complaint Mr Booker realized missing groundlevel data community impact brokenwindows policing Newark
I established reliable analytics type issue wrote At time I fond using old saying In God trust everyone else bring data I making critical mistake looking good data policecommunity relation misconduct I confusing activity progress
So Justice Department announced would investigating allegation police brutality baseless search intimidation false arrest become commonplace Newark mayor held news conference changed tune

LOS ANGELES The woman blackandwhite program flatscreen TV teetering brink madness delivering disjointed monologue parallel world possibility physical duplicate might walk among u As camera hovered troubled face decadesold audio crackled sound persistent rainstorm Jordan Peele sat captivated nearby couch Beautiful shot said quiet awe
Here personal office Peele celebrated comedian turned Academy Awardwinning horror filmmaker watching old episode The Twilight Zone classic sciencefiction anthology series helping revive
On recent March morning Peele calculation chosen 1960 installment called Mirror Image show debut season It star Vera Miles Psycho woman convinced followed exact double Martin Milner Route 66 man doesnt believe late
Peele pointed Mirror Image inspiration new film Us Lupita Nyongo family besieged murderous doppelgängers He also admires episode written Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling ability elicit jumpscares without relying supernatural beast extraterrestrial being In favorite tale terror Peele told I love human being monster horror
This suspenseful juncture Peele grew revering The Twilight Zone Serling particular imbuing show social consciousness using genre trope address ill anxiety Cold Warera America
Four year end Key Peele two year directorial debut Get Out hit thriller seemingly wellintentioned white people insert black people body Peele executive producer new Twilight Zone series The first episode released April 1 CBS All Access He also playing part dapper deadpan narrator bookending episode Serling show
Peele accepted oncamera role warily uneasy bringing back The Twilight Zone He doesnt easily embrace comparison Serling singularly influential figure television wrote many show beloved segment helped audience see contemporary consequence story enchanted artifact interstellar travel nuclear Armageddon
But tale unlikely parallel Peele shadowing Serlings trajectory along whether want admit He used genre entertainment convey otherwise unpalatable truth viewer deploying sketch comedy comment police brutality horror movie skewer selfsatisfied liberal
In effort resuscitate The Twilight Zone reminded valuable lesson might explain worthy successor Serlings mantle instructive philosophy Peele said applicable horror comedy Always thinking ahead viewer
If predict audience think going go use said And theyll love
These day many twist turn Peeles life including vertiginous path Hollywood Hills outpost company Monkeypaw Productions The building sparsely furnished colonial home Us edited personal office decorated vinyl doll creepy twin girl The Shining lunch box depicting Daniel Kaluuyas tearstreaked face Get Out oh yes Oscar Peele writing screenplay
The smash success Get Out took 255 million worldwide enabled Peele produce countless project including Spike Lees BlacKkKlansman Amazon documentary series Lorena well coming horror offering like HBO series Lovecraft Country remake movie Candyman
Peele 40 doesnt carry like budding medium mogul He dressed today like stylish cult member black sweat clothes white Nikes spoke softly haltingly accomplishment Obviously I ego said Im constant attempt remind I come humble Its I work best
Before broke professional portrayer President Obama college football player name like LCarpetron Dookmarriot Peele still unapologetic popculture geek grew Gremlins Jaws Tim Burton movie Another crucial touchstone The Twilight Zone It originally aired CBS 1959 1964 mother introduced rerun
Peele pretty sure first episode saw To Serve Man 1962 human discover titular text seemingly benevolent alien race actually cookbook Though time familiarity reduced twist ending dad joke Peele argued To Serve Man still bonechilling You tell somebody sound pretty silly watch episode youre ready believe said
His pop perspective shaped vintage installment also written Serling The Monsters Are Due Maple Street I Am Night Color Me Black dealt directly societal bias racism cruelly ironic episode like Time Enough Last Burgess Meredith play bookish survivor atomic apocalypse stranded lifetime supply reading material pair broken glass
I love one essentially take someone tragic flaw exploit Peele said You set character show tailormade worst nightmare
Serling died 1975 envisioned The Twilight Zone delivery system parable deliberate message social justice allegory human weakness folly coated digestible layer fantasy
As widow Carol Serling told scifi trapping allowed husband avoid creative interference get point across social feeling wanted talk
In era television said You couldnt couldnt couldnt put Chrysler Building onscreen another car company sponsoring show crazy He felt escaping outer space speak could get story across
The Twilight Zone already spawned 1983 movie two TV revival 19859 20023 none regarded anywhere near fondly original series For past year Simon Kinberg writer producer director XMen film franchise contemplating new TV incarnation couldnt crack Should tell serialized story Feature repertory cast Take place actual location called Twilight Zone These change felt gimmicky wrong
More crucially Kinberg said There wasnt feeling historical relevancy show living moment least perceived stability
Then two thing happened first 2016 presidential election Next Kinberg colleague saw Get Out regarded modernday Twilight Zone right Soon Peele Kinberg meeting hash idea realizing perhaps show classic formula didnt need updating
In many way feel like somehow wire got crossed wrong dimension supposed like Peele said It felt like Serling hed lot say lot new episode couldnt written back time
Their new installment include Nightmare 30000 Feet teleplay Marco Ramirez story Peele Kinberg Ramirez homage sort Twilight Zone original Nightmare 20000 Feet starring Adam Scott airline passenger convinced flight terrible danger Another episode Replay written Selwyn Seyfu Hinds follows mother son played Sanaa Lathan Damson Idris road trip pursued tenacious state trooper Glenn Fleshler
What Twilight Zone share Serlings series Peele said sense simplicity narrative arc heightening revelation end pattern subverted committed even
Each episode also requires called Serling wink We take seriously never seriously Peele said It cant go dark make u want curl ball This one way belief The Twilight Zone distinguish Black Mirror Netflixs acclaimed anthology series technological dystopia Peele said fan show go darrrrrrk Dark dark As dark anything Ive ever seen I love
There also matter getting Peele narrator new show recite eerie prologue adaptation Marius Constants nerveruffling Twilight Zone theme dress Serlingesque suit appear unexpectedly say TV monitor diner booth deliver crucial context moral accounting
Despite urging fellow producer Peele said worried comedy résumé would disqualify role My initial feeling wont people picturing like Puppy Dog IceT said referring one Key Peele character Doesnt take gravity
But eventually Peele explained situation felt set aside ego embrace suggestion collaborator
I didnt want overthink Peele said I didnt want impression Serling I want conjure tone You cant exact way Ive got real Ive got
Themes double identity recur throughout Peeles work he thinking since least high school decided wanted director declared would someday make version Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde Looking film Peele said Get Out Frankenstein Us Jekyll Hyde
All work pointed idea humanity dark side Peele added We demon sewn DNA Evolution brought u place want good part But well never good Well always side
When turned attention TV screen playing Mirror Image Peele fascinated strange economical decision set action small bus station upstate New York He empathized protagonist whose truthful complaint go largely unheeded relished climactic scene see double already sitting bus board smiling back window
That little knowing smirk terrifying said sounding half horrified half delighted Its one thing see another existence another thing see another already aware exist
At least two Jordan Peeles would seem required world account volume variety work generated recently Or maybe productivity act defying double making something counterpart first show sinister intention
OK deal Peele said chuckling outright Theres innately something doppelgänger suggests one must die Theres space one

On May 10 2017 le 24 hour President Trump fired James Comey FBI director Comey received email man never met The correspondent Matt Latimer began praising Comeys decade faithful service United States government cause law order offering sympathy tumultuous period going Then Latimer got heart matter As head Washington literary agency called Javelin wanted Comey know ever interest writing book wed urge consider possibility wanted Comey client
Javelin prepared invest story Latimer wrote Its least someone given much country
Comey want write book He sent Latimer polite response saying much But several month later began warm idea thought back correspondence Latimer There something tone email Comey recently told I liked tone
Latimer Keith Urbahn Latimers partner Javelin went lunch Comey golf club Their pitch We partner way thats unusual literaryagency business Comey recalled Before literary agent Latimer Urbahn Republican operative viewed book project akin political campaign They told Comey would work proposal shop publisher would also help writing social medium presence publicity called messaging whole project They promised offer brutal feedback time One big challenge place especially Washington getting people tell unvarnished truth especially stink Comey said I knew I could count guy tell I sucked
Comey come around idea writing book wanted said useful wake something bad happening make something good come He envisioned memoir leadership book reflecting lesson learned course long career What want write anything 109 tumultuous day Trumps FBI director I desperate Trump book writer told
Latimer Urbahn gave brutal feedback late We convinced come book doesnt deal thing people want know hell happened room one one Trump youre going leaving major question unanswered people unsatisfied Urbahn said And youre going asked anyway They sold Comey idea storydriven book career including experience Trump word memoir essentially tricked people learning leadership lesson hoped convey Their logic strong Comey said
Comey insisted writing book forgoing ghostwriter leaned heavily Latimer Urbahn editorial assistance The draft sent would come back slashed Comey recalled They vision I didnt They also possessed understanding political medium landscape Comey even publisher lacked We knew minute book came going people criticizing didnt go far enough Latimer said He didnt say Trump Russian agent Theres news Blah blah blah So wanted set book term early
Last March month book publication date Latimer Urbahn Comey tweet Trump Mr President American people hear story soon They hosted gettoknowyou meeting Comey news anchor vying first interview negotiated network primetime slot They briefed reporter background book newsiest bit
When finally arrived bookstore A Higher Loyalty Truth Lies Leadership indeed tell lesson ethical leadership Comey learned rolling Gambino crime family prosecuting Martha Stewart But book final 90 page received attention Comey offered dramatic blowbyblow account FBI investigation Russias effort help Trump 2016 campaign hairraising interaction Trump election Before even reached publication day Urbahn said sold half million copy
One morning February I went see Latimer Urbahn office sits second floor 19thcentury rowhouse Washington suburb Alexandria Va A steady snowfall obscured usual view Potomac River office window Latimer 48 Urbahn 35 dressed weather khaki duck boot like couple prepschool English teacher Their work space feel cozy reading room lot exposed brick shelf crammed book along occasional bottle bourbon Posters client book jacket decorate wall Most typical Washington fare campaign biography Ted Cruz book Nancy Reagan former press secretary reportage essay political journalist pundit
Since A Higher Loyalty published townhouse become popular destination Trump administration official especially contemplating exit way Urbahn told Theyre planning get Latimer chimed Weve met talked probably every major official would know departed thinking departing Trump White House said
Read secretary state Mike Pompeo one last remaining memebers Trumps original White House team
The problem official many White House exit nailed shut The path executive branch highly remunerative privatesector work standard postadministration trajectory better worse recent decade used smooth Barack Obamas press secretary Jay Carney Amazon George W Bushs communication director Dan Bartlett Walmart attest While veteran Trumps State Treasury Departments tended navigate path successfully enough people worked controversial precinct Trump World hard time even getting job interview If publicly traded company CEO doesnt worry blowback shareholder hire someone administration one former senior Trump administration official requested anonymity discus travail friend colleague told They concerned employee going react If company office Silicon Valley New York Los Angeles DC hard play
Latimer Urbahn turned professional abyss market niche Their central insight hoary old fixture Washington selfpromotion tellall may ideal solution new problem postTrump rehabilitation A juicy memoir stand earn former Trump official small fortune thanks unprecedented interest administration intrigue It also give official opportunity reposition redeem A lot trying figure How I make something wellbeing Latimer told But also How I distance guy
After two helped Comey land book advance shy 3 million 2017 Urbahn said people whose entire job basically undermine Comey came u asking u think next step Last year Latimer secured former White House aide Cliff Sims sevenfigure deal book Trump experience Team Vipers published January Now rarely week go Latimer Urbahn dont hear someone administration
As result Latimer Urbahn ceased agent theyve become career counselor life coach The challenge Trump people theyre looking legitimacy theyre looking sort outlet unburden baggage come job Urbahn said Some honest others
They dream Trump author Latimers anonymous senior Trump official wrote OpEd The New York Times last September effort thwart president within administration Urbahns Robert Mueller But Trump figure would dismiss hand I asked would interested representing Rudy Giuliani We pretty much mind probably would meet almost anyone least see Latimer said The question Urbahn added If there money made going feel good helping someone redemption tour
Granted conscience always salved One person came u would know said If I turned Trump book much money could I get Is worth Latimer recalled And like Its hard know tell u everything want say The potential client hesitated many card willing reveal
So Latimer said still talking person
In 1985 Michael Kinsley editor The New Republic colleague visit several Washington bookstore place note deep inside copy three important supposedly well read political book year offering 5 reward anyone found one note No one ever claimed money
The stunt illustrated fundamental truth Washington book While may sell theyre rarely read And would Washington book tend dull design safe campaign memoir senator governor bloodlessly telling rise prepares embark White House run legacyburnishing memoir retired cabinet official recounting equally bloodless tale challenge met competitor bested obstacle overcome
But Washington tellall often exception rule The modern trend book date 1986 David Stockman Ronald Reagans first budget director wrote The Triumph Politics devastating account Reagan White House fundamentally unwilling unable tame government spending Reagan promised ran president Stockman sort administration official previously would le anonymous public But proximity power important willing dish
Stockman professed civic responsibility grown concerned said fiscal consequence Reagan administration supplyside economics But lucrative form responsibility He received 24 million advance book went best seller became foundational text Reagan critic
Some way leave Trump White House
Stockmans deal brokered Robert Barnett lawyer Washington law firm Williams Connolly Barnett former top aide Walter Mondale mostly whitecollar defense work Stockmans book led impressive side hustle He would later handle book deal Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton George W Bush Barack Obama Michelle Obama among others invariably came described press superlawyer Barnett bill client hour rather taking publishing industry standard 15 percent commission bridle called agent
Barnett continued represent political player like Stockman lesser sufficient Washington wattage including former Clinton communication director George Stephanopoulos Bush adviser Karl Rove Obama strategist David Axelrod He also represented Bushs first defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld selling 2011 memoir Known Unknown
But Rumsfeld came back Barnett idea book leadership lesson Rumsfelds Rules Barnett unenthusiastic prospect This rankled Rumsfelds ghostwriter Latimer Urbahn met year earlier speechwriter Rumsfelds office Pentagon Latimer already knew something publishing industry written funny incisive political memoir Speechless time speechwriter Rumsfeld later George W Bush He Urbahn took Rumsfeld first client Rumsfeld got 1 million advance HarperCollins Latimer Urbahn founded Javelin naming agency handle Secret Service given Rumsfelds wife They set sight displacing Barnett king Washington literary hill
For year Barnett looked nose Latimer Urbahn claiming client often people already rejected But Comeys decision sign Javelin suggested Trumps election disrupted Washington literary scene along everything else In initial email Comey pitching Javelins service Latimer wrote We confident beat advance youd receive working agent socalled superlawyer
Barnett isnt exactly hurting business last year No1 Michelle Obama No5 Bob Woodward nonfiction best seller representing former Trump administration official Gary Cohn Nikki Haley forthcoming book But Trump era spelled end nearmonopoly brokering political blockbuster Bob Barnett establishment establishment went one book editor specializes political title worked Barnett Javelin told But look bestseller list day establishment anymore In new paradigm dont need former chief economic adviser former United Nations ambassador former FBI director matter get sevenfigure advance tellall
You could instance Cliff Sims As typical Trump era Simss path prominence random circuitous A former junior college basketball player Christianrockband frontman wandered politics running conservative website became megaphone Mike Hubbard rapacious corrupt speaker House Representatives Simss home state Alabama This turn led Trump campaign led White House worked January 2017 May 2018 communication aide
Sims admirer Trump remains sympathetic though fashion cleareyed president But butted head number White House colleague including John Kelly chief staff ultimately blocked advancement In one memorable dustup Kelly Sims argued whether Sims permission get Trump sign football already autographed University Alabamas national championship team Sims hoped give Alabamas governor When Sims decided wanted write book chose Latimer Urbahn agent part told working White House saw firsthand whoever press comms Comey book good

Sims initially hoped write selfhelp book entrepreneur along line The 21 Irrefutable Laws Leadership pastor motivational speaker John Maxwell But Latimer Urbahn prodded toward memoir They encouraged write would write werent afraid Sims said They encouraged honest And I think thats book kind stood marketplace The Spicer book I guess example book people didnt find credible
Sims referring Sean Spicer Simss old White House bos cautionary tale Early short tenure Trumps press secretary Spicer contacted Latimer Urbahn knew Spicer day Republican National Committee spokesman help plotting escape Matts advice Look youve got leave term Urbahn said If think time go havent pulled cord yet late
The agent laid careful exit strategy Spicer began resignation medium blackout eventually memoir overly critical Trump acknowledged president Spicers shortcoming finally new career pundit Karl Rove model Urbahn explained When Spicer announced resignation July 21 2017 Latimer Urbahn assumed plan motion
Then saw news Twitter Spicer would appearing Sean Hannitys Fox News show night Urbahn called Spicer immediately I said I saw youre going go Hannity tonight Youre literally going cost seven figure Youre going telegraph world everything copacetic Trump youre going biggest fan outside Its want told u game plan go contributor television
Spicer went Hannity anyway Latimer Urbahn eventually gave He hired Barnett get TV contract superlawyer couldnt deliver Using different agent Spicer wound getting publishing deal Trump memoir The Briefing one would mistaken tellall sell well Last month became special correspondent entertainment news show Extra In debut quizzed Secretary State Mike Pompeo music listens
Things went similarly sideways Omarosa Manigault Newman erstwhile Apprentice star former White House aide In early 2018 Latimer Urbahn negotiated substantial contract Hachette book would offer extremely critical take Trump But several week agreement hand Manigault Newman without informing Hachette appeared CBS reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother offered disparaging remark Trump thereby undercutting surprise book Hachette backed deal
Represented different agent Manigault Newman later signed book deal Simon Schuster CBS subsidiary After Sims signed book deal Manigault Newman sent brief congratulatory text Juicy She Spicer failed understand Latimer told key getting Trump World view mystery
Of course make successful tellall book mystery also revelation contains alarming better The specter ballooning deficit counted alarming Stockmans day seems quaint compared Comeys fear Trump colluded foreign adversary obstructed justice Indeed stake attached charge made Trump tellalls high fair ask charge delivered book In past insider perceived secret sort stake whether straightarrow administration official like John Dean canny bureaucratic operator like Mark Felt rogue whistleblower like Daniel Ellsberg Edward Snowden couch least first bid bestseller list Would dire warning Comey successor Andrew McCabe whose book The Threat How FBI Protects America Age Terror Trump published February carry weight author werent receiving million
Thats reasonable question Comey conceded In case I would suggest I offered free public testimony June 8 2017 That Comey appeared Senate Intelligence Committee revealed among thing Trump directed stop investigating former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn That essence story Comey continued rest Im trying offer broader well beyond Trump lesson leader

The Alliance latest long line upstart professional football league tried failed capitalize seemingly insatiable appetite sport America Because NFL draw average 15 million viewer game fivemonth season startup owner tend assume new league fraction audience succeed
It hasnt turned way
Since American Football League merged NFL 1970 World Football League United States Football League future XFL United Football League others While varying business model franchise location opinion best calendar football none league yet found right formula sustained success
Now seems Alliance American Football soon follow grave
The league chief executive cofounder Charlie Ebersol probably known better He son Dick Ebersol longtime NBC Sports chairman started first iteration XFL nearly 20 year ago alongside professional wrestling impresario Vince McMahon That league folded single season
With help Polian former general manager Indianapolis Colts Ebersol secured distribution deal league game CBS TNT NFL Network strong sign new league The deal included little cash however according two people
I think blind spot people want start professional sport league said Michael Huyghue commissioner United Football League The biggest issue What revenue stream What revenue model The UFL began play 2009 ceased operation 2012
Most league require substantial television right payment survive well critical mass ticket sale Both difficult obtain unproven league Knowing substantial startup cost would Alliance tried justify operation comparing Silicon Valley tech company expects lose money year creating value Ebersol believed league technology readiness legalized gambling would make success
From beginning Ebersol modest expectation Year One
There going empty seat quite time committed longterm investment around idea said interview February shortly season began
He estimated Alliance would require 500 million 750 million first five year
You justify expense either eccentric billionaire creating football league raising really smart money patient Ebersol said
The Alliances eight team clustered Southeast Southwest began play Super Bowl They played eight regular season game championship game scheduled April 27 Frisco Tex
But almost beginning sign thing werent going well including report league almost missed payroll
Last week league controlling owner Tom Dundon told USA Today league danger folding hadnt secured agreement NFL NFL Players Association allow young player NFL roster work Alliance
If player union going give u young player cant development league said Dundon also owner NHLs Carolina Hurricanes Just two week Alliances game schedule committed 250 million became controlling owner
But Huyghue whose United Football League lasted almost four season wrong focus
Everyone keep thinking player player player said That doesnt solve revenue problem
Polians statement blamed Dundon decision suspend league When Mr Dundon took belief cofounder Charlie Ebersol would finish season pay creditor make necessary adjustment move forward manner made economic sense Polian said
Dundon could reached comment
Despite poor track record Alliance surely wont last attempt start new professional football league McMahon reviving XFL begin play next year last week sold almost 272 million World Wrestling Entertainment stock support venture according company filing The Pacific Pro League founded Don Yee Tom Bradys agent also set start playing next year
The AAFs decision shut immediate repercussion least one Alliances partner Saturday afternoon game Memphis San Antonio scheduled shown CBS serving leadin two men Final Four college basketball game

They taking part idiosyncrasy Australian economic system Here selling home tends almost festive gathering potential buyer show auction neighbor stop watch spectacle quietly calibrate much home might worth
On muggy day almost assembled crowd turned gawker four people actually raised bidding paddle point After bidding opened 750000 Australian dollar 532000 US action started slowly Twice seemed petering auctioneer Andrew Robinson nearly banged final gavel extended one bid Finally young couple whose agent lobbed 930000 Australian dollar 661000 offer day
It reflected wheezing Australian housing market Prices fallen since country bank tightened lending standard mid2018 Chinese government made harder citizen buy property abroad Not long ago number interested party might double
Twelve 18 month ago would sold 11 million said Mr Robinson Belle Property packed gavel paper prepared head next auction day would conduct eight There frenzied atmosphere people bidding didnt want lose
I flown 16000 mile study economic malaise opposite remarkable resilience Australian economy gone nearly 28 year without recession The government election take place next month recently announced expected surplus next budget year
Surely grand economic success story would hold lesson United States rest world right
Yet instead giddy enthusiasm I found Sydney pervasive sense caution wariness involving real estate though housing loom large discussion economy In conversation Australian businesspeople college student economist government official I detected sense triumphalism
An entire generation young adult grown without experiencing protracted downturn But Australia I came learn nobody really act theyre star unprecedented threedecade success story Theyre aware good time could end The mood practicality pessimism
America verge economic milestone The current expansion track reach 10th birthday summer would also put record nation longest streak without recession
During decade Ive spent chronicling growth economics writer persistent whisper How long go The run uneven underwhelming repeatedly verge unraveling including scary moment 2010 2015 past December Seemingly every commentator without good cliché blocker referred long tooth
Even language economics suggests end good time inevitable If youre going call business cycle thing cant keep getting better forever Some history great economic thinker theorized downturn essential working economy season agriculture
Is Australia unique case beneficiary good economic luck replicated rest world Or nation onto something lesson economic policy applicable everywhere
When I landed midMarch waning day Australian summer thats I hoped figure
Ask Australian economist golden run almost say driven partly good luck partly good policy
The luck part cant minimized Beneath ground large stretch Australia iron ore coal raw material behind Chinas long economic boom Above ground lie wheat cattle helped feed Chinas rapidly growing middleclass population
Chinas growth word created tailwind boosted Australias economy much period And Chinese economy ever truly tank even skilled policymakers Australia hard time preventing recession
But Chinas gravitational pull explain much For one thing country nearby recession severe recent decade And long list policy choice enabled long Australian boom even otherwise similar economy sank
One episode particularly telling In 1997 East Asian financial crisis walloped economy country like South Korea Thailand Indonesia These nation major buyer Australian export The value Australian dollar started fall global currency market putting expansion risk six year
On side Tasman Sea New Zealands central bank responded problem raising interest rate After falling New Zealand dollar indicated lack confidence currency implied inflation would soon rise
At Reserve Bank Australia contrast official concluded falling value Australian dollar reflected shifting economic fundamental ultimately healthy part Australian economy could adapt faltering demand East Asia
Rather raise interest rate try prevent falling currency viewed falling currency key navigating peril making Australian export competitive United States Europe example
The government uncomfortable exchange rate went low looked like sign confidence said Malcolm Edey central bank head economic research time We good monetary framework place stuck didnt panic exchange rate moved around along way
Sure enough New Zealand fell recession 1997 1998 Australia endured period subpar growth Good policy turn way creating good luck And wasnt time
If looked around world circa 2006 would seen number country housing price soared potential bubble territory including United States Britain Australia
But two year later United States Britain severe recession financial crisis Australia experienced single quarter contraction Why difference
The answer seems financial industry country structured regulated To understand better I sought tutor one turned unlikely background David Morgan former child actor professional Australian Rules Football player later became one country leading banker
After wave deregulation 1980s Australian bank took evermorerisky lending especially commercial real estate got new business line overseas obvious competitive advantage When asset bubble popped recession arrived bank came near failure wholesale firing top bank executive
It matter going furnace coming tempered experience said Mr Morgan chief executive Westpac one Australias major bank crisis We adamant would go next shock least risk resilience would engage offshore frolic
The bank prodding regulator reformulated take conservative domestically focused approach lending After neardeath experience remained Big Four bank together control 80 percent deposit allowed merge
The bank also engage kind expansionist strategy gotten trouble 1991 They open huge office Hong Kong London New York get business creating complex mortgage security nexus financial crisis
Good regulation part They good quality regulator public sector getting good people Mr Morgan said Both major political party tended tough bank single powerful regulator rather patchwork United States
But important sense among bank leader would need ready next downturn came
Its Australias bank perfect actor A royal commission established examine industry found widespread misconduct including abuse customer report issued year
But focused lending Australians especially home mortgage held loan book No doubt Australia missed opportunity hosting big complicated bank operate worldwide sophisticated form finance Sydney concentration highpaying finance job London Hong Kong
But conservative domestically focused highly concentrated banking system meant Australia wasnt stuck importing country financial contagion crisis hit
During global financial crisis Australia suffered plummeting demand product But nicely designed fiscal stimulus combined falling Australian dollar assist aggressive stimulus China helped country regain footing rapidly avoid mass economic pain found much world
If there anyone would expect bullish might young adult entering work force never lived recession But among Australians dont occupy hall government financial power find angst uncertainty rather boomtime optimism
I think recession within next 10 year said George Ye 25 studying master degree data science University Sydney I feel like sentiment might gotten peak Things gone well long thing need buy getting expensive especially housing I think generation people born 10 year prior much confident I
Im pessimistic said Freya Zemek 24 employee university I think probably looking recession 2020 Consumer confidence isnt high The sign arent looking great I think sort tightrope situation could next recession Its matter time Nothing go forever
Housing especially seems opposite sweet spot Its still expensive especially booming Sydney Melbourne young people Yet price well couple year ago leaving recent buyer sitting paper loss
But maybe contrast pessimistic mood long record economic success isnt contradictory may seem
In November 1990 Australian treasurer later prime minister Paul Keating described painful downturn underway recession
His point excess lending credit boom combined high inflation meant Australian economy needed wrenching experience downturn rid excess It also horrible political gaffe comment went poorly country burdened 11 percent unemployment rate
But question whether right profound one economist still debate
The great economic thinker Joseph Schumpeter argued recession served essential purging mechanism enabling society become richer time Through business failure capital redeployed emerging highgrowth industry In thinking recession play cleansing effect clearing way future
Hyman Minsky another 20thcentury economist argued long period financial stability could breed complacency The longer nation go without downturn risky behavior build economy making eventual downturn worse
Those theory sound plausible Data support case little harder find In fact evidence recession actually cause lasting damage country economic potential hurt rather help thrusting people work force unnecessarily causing skill atrophy Research show people enter work force recession take hit earnings even decade later
There also long period Minskyite story seemed apply notably decade World War II United States
I think Australias experience show dont need recession clean system show need strong clear policy setting government said James Pearson chief executive Australian Chamber Commerce Industry There risk I think seeing Australia today prolonged period economic growth without recession lead complacency among policymakers electorate
But brings u back slowing housing market general sense pessimism sneak conversation economy Australia especially among young
Maybe real reason Australia made long without downturn absence complacency No one brimming overconfidence well always
What happened last 27 year series shock thanks policy luck able overcome said Stephen Grenville former deputy governor Reserve Bank Australia fellow Lowy Institute Thats nature economy economy shock plus flexibility
It isnt absence bad stuff happening economy kept Australia growing long It nation economic flexibility policymakers rejection complacency
So maybe pessimism isnt paradox And maybe would worried Australias economic future house price kept soaring toward unsustainable high young people made economic decision sense reckless invincibility engaged borrowing spending behavior accordingly
The Australian experience evidence business cycle misleading way think economic growth Recessions arent like thunderstorm inevitable random event may violent provide muchneeded water crop
Maybe recession like car crash They may never completely eliminated making right choice make rarer le damaging happen
In trying learn lesson Australia may biggest There always bad thing happen economy The best way keep causing mass pain accompanies recession combine sound policy flexible dynamic economy perhaps important right amount fear

As Americans worry potential end 10year expansion worth studying Aussies whose winning streak turn 28

SYDNEY One Saturday March suburb north Sydney around three dozen people gathered lawn outside smallish twobedroom apartment
They taking part idiosyncrasy Australian economic system Here selling home tends almost festive gathering potential buyer show auction neighbor stop watch spectacle quietly calibrate much home might worth
On muggy day almost assembled crowd turned gawker four people actually raised bidding paddle point After bidding opened 750000 Australian dollar 532000 US action started slowly Twice seemed petering auctioneer Andrew Robinson nearly banged final gavel extended one bid Finally young couple whose agent lobbed 930000 Australian dollar 661000 offer day
It reflected wheezing Australian housing market Prices fallen since country bank tightened lending standard mid2018 Chinese government made harder citizen buy property abroad Not long ago number interested party might double
Twelve 18 month ago would sold 11 million said Mr Robinson Belle Property packed gavel paper prepared head next auction day would conduct eight There frenzied atmosphere people bidding didnt want lose
I flown 16000 mile study economic malaise opposite remarkable resilience Australian economy gone nearly 28 year without recession The government election take place next month recently announced expected surplus next budget year
Surely grand economic success story would hold lesson United States rest world right
Yet instead giddy enthusiasm I found Sydney pervasive sense caution wariness involving real estate though housing loom large discussion economy In conversation Australian businesspeople college student economist government official I detected sense triumphalism
An entire generation young adult grown without experiencing protracted downturn But Australia I came learn nobody really act theyre star unprecedented threedecade success story Theyre aware good time could end The mood practicality pessimism
America verge economic milestone The current expansion track reach 10th birthday summer would also put record nation longest streak without recession
During decade Ive spent chronicling growth economics writer persistent whisper How long go The run uneven underwhelming repeatedly verge unraveling including scary moment 2010 2015 past December Seemingly every commentator without good cliché blocker referred long tooth
Even language economics suggests end good time inevitable If youre going call business cycle thing cant keep getting better forever Some history great economic thinker theorized downturn essential working economy season agriculture
Is Australia unique case beneficiary good economic luck replicated rest world Or nation onto something lesson economic policy applicable everywhere
When I landed midMarch waning day Australian summer thats I hoped figure
Ask Australian economist golden run almost say driven partly good luck partly good policy

Hyman Minsky another 20thcentury economist argued long period financial stability could breed complacency The longer nation go without downturn risky behavior build economy making eventual downturn worse
Those theory sound plausible Data support case little harder find In fact evidence recession actually cause lasting damage country economic potential hurt rather help thrusting people work force unnecessarily causing skill atrophy Research show people enter work force recession take hit earnings even decade later
There also long period Minskyite story seemed apply notably decade World War II United States
I think Australias experience show dont need recession clean system show need strong clear policy setting government said James Pearson chief executive Australian Chamber Commerce Industry There risk I think seeing Australia today prolonged period economic growth without recession lead complacency among policymakers electorate
But brings u back slowing housing market general sense pessimism sneak conversation economy Australia especially among young
Maybe real reason Australia made long without downturn absence complacency No one brimming overconfidence well always
What happened last 27 year series shock thanks policy luck able overcome said Stephen Grenville former deputy governor Reserve Bank Australia fellow Lowy Institute Thats nature economy economy shock plus flexibility
It isnt absence bad stuff happening economy kept Australia growing long It nation economic flexibility policymakers rejection complacency
So maybe pessimism isnt paradox And maybe would worried Australias economic future house price kept soaring toward unsustainable high young people made economic decision sense reckless invincibility engaged borrowing spending behavior accordingly
The Australian experience evidence business cycle misleading way think economic growth Recessions arent like thunderstorm inevitable random event may violent provide muchneeded water crop
Maybe recession like car crash They may never completely eliminated making right choice make rarer le damaging happen
In trying learn lesson Australia may biggest There always bad thing happen economy The best way keep causing mass pain accompanies recession combine sound policy flexible dynamic economy perhaps important right amount fear

The main part really learning part I didnt know understand CBA salary cap term salary cap who freeagenttobe Johnson told USA Today challenge faced building roster understanding collective bargaining agreement
Part issue might Johnson could never basketball executive He mogul cultural force While NBA team primarily lean decision maker focusing solely basketball Johnson seemed always eye something bigger game reaching business tentacle many corner possible
Johnson acquired 45 percent share Lakers 1994 selling stake 2010 He even hosted syndicated latenight talk show 1998s The Magic Hour And never one game either acquiring minority stake Dodgers 2012 one Los Angeles Football Club Major League Soccer 2014

Since beginning time masculinity part society expected men They protector fighter risked life save family So questioning masculinity Isnt something cant change men deal struggle everyone go
Every human earth go trouble whether money friend family Both male female deal social structure life never escape Men want told people whether theyre feminine masculine They also shouldnt scrutinized man naturally testosterone act fight driving aggressively By saying anyone wont act naturally like saying people wont sad happy jealous
If men stop men world would ruined We men woman reason role society crucial By saying one change act like counterintuitive

Malcolm L Stewart lawyer federal government come prepared elaborate circumlocution calling word equivalent past participle form paradigmatic profane word culture
Erik Brunetti owner clothing line sometimes said name FUCT stood Friends U Cant Trust But justice seemed persuaded term amounted vulgarity

Justice Alito added First Amendments ordinary skepticism law make distinction based speaker viewpoint may apply word
Like 99 percent time 95 percent time said used express word literally mean Its used say Im mad I want get attention Its like shouting
An official Patent Trademark Office denied Mr Brunettis application federal protection term 1905 federal law allows office refuse register trademark immoral deceptive scandalous
The justice seemed equally troubled law several said vague inconsistently applied consequence ruling Mr Brunettis favor said would encourage use swear word charged racial epithet
The case Iancu v Brunetti No 18302 complicated 2017 decision court unanimously struck neighboring clause part trademark law That clause denied federal trademark protection term disparage people living dead along institution belief national symbol
In 2017 case Matal v Tam court ruled AsianAmerican dancerock band called Slants entitled federal trademark registration The decision also effectively allowed Washington Redskins football team register trademark
The justice seemed find provision issue Mondays case challenging Mr Stewart said government would enforce challenged provision narrowly light 2017 decision focusing term shocking offensive based mode expression rather idea convey

When politician renown leave public office often turn specialinterest lobbying corporate advisory work David Miliband took different path
A rising star British politics Mr Miliband 29 became adviser Prime Minister Tony Blair He joined Parliament held various cabinet position Mr Blair Prime Minister Gordon Brown But 2010 party lost general election Mr Miliband fell short race lead Labour Party narrowly losing brother Ed
In 2013 Mr Miliband 53 accepted job president chief executive International Rescue Committee nonprofit humanitarian group based New York The IRC work crisis zone around world delivering food medical aid education people upended conflict disaster Mr Miliband using IRCs platform call attention underlying cause crisis organization seek address also staying close field next month travel Africa update group work fighting Ebola
This interview condensed edited clarity conducted IRCs office New York
I read father Marxist sociologist Did inform view growing
My memory father Marxist sociologist It dad drove five kid back blue car Saturday morning soccer Leeds Undoubtedly I grew political household Both parent survivor World War II survivor Holocaust way I guess two thing important relate question respect One politics important value important And second think
What mum
She history teacher originally became stayathome mum I think would describe feminist quite political well
So raised Marxist feminist Thats quite combination
And probably feminist taught Marxist couldnt Marxist werent willing feminist
And parent came UK refugee
My dad dad fled Germans invaded Belgium 1940 My dad learned English qualified London School Economics My mom came UK age 12 1946 Poland Her father killed concentration camp There rabbi brought child without parent UK mother sent start new life child refugee
What study school
I got interested politics I began understand British politics come way I left kept losing Why And I sort came conclusion make difference And dont waste
You several different role politics What policy decision involved feel consequential
I involved writing manifesto 97 general election That probably significant document Ive ever involved writing We ditch load bad policy invent load good policy could persuade voter change country I think government actually impact medium term realize We changed country quite fundamental way Socially economically matter peace war Northern Ireland I honor people politics whatever side In experience vast majority MPs charlatan
You also served environmental secretary focused climate change
In 2006 I mean halcyon day financial crisis launched Climate Change Bill became Climate Change Act And American ear may sound extraordinary set bind every future administration 2006 2050 longterm commitment reduce carbon emission originally 60 percent 80 percent It robust piece legislation Obviously economy badly UK badly moment easier meet carbon target But I think overwhelming generational challenge
What precipitated exit politics
I lost two election 2010 One general election party lost One leadership election I lost brother I still member Parliament I presented choice silence division I could either remain silent sort violate basic purpose politician persuade people Or I spoke Id divisive play soap opera
And join IRC
I remember saying hiring committee I wanted job three reason I sort pushed UK One issue border difficult question global public policy How get medical aid Syria How teach girl Afghanistan How tackle sexual violence Congo Nevermind fight Ebola Congo moment
Second IRC sleeping giant roused leader global humanitarian sector It responsibility step global leadership role
And third parent refugee I felt way I closing circle dedicating professional life helping people many way different family shared tragic circumstance
When talk IRC becoming roused giant refugee crisis getting worse today
Its getting worse Weve got 685 million refugee internally displaced people people fleeing war advanced persecution Thats including people fleeing economic reason Weve got Venezuela Central America And I think IRC distinctive story tell working war zone refugee hosting state refugee transit route refugee resettlement
When look size challenge described optimistic pessimistic
If look statistic get depressed If look people hope If youre looking hope think woman Kampala who South Sudanese refugee lost sister who got employment thanks grant got u shes paid daughter go college college daughter learned become nurse nurse want go back South Sudan If theyre pessimistic excuse
Where stand Steven Pinkers argument overall world getting better
Well Ive got big caveat Its true generalized trend toward peace prosperity positive But acute counterexample pain suffering getting worse What seems need recognize relying generalized trend toward peace prosperity really enough pick hundred million people get caught place fragile conflictridden
Whats opinion Trump administration border policy
My reaction critical abandonment Americas historic role humanitarian leader Thats political statement Its statement policy Reducing number refugee threequarters accord Americas value dont think Americas interest Reducing aid Central America accord Americas value probably increased number people fleeing north The IRC reunites family around world war zone see one richest country world separating family obviously critical
What thought Brexit
Its sort like watching neverending football match team permanently shipping goal The fact even referendum breakdown politics parliamentary democracy plebiscitary democracy The fact lost referendum breakdown politics The conduct negotiation since referendum breakdown politics effect going felt many year come
We dont know whats going happen honestly Im sick Americans saying You make u feel le bad I dont like object pity state country warning thing go south pretty fast
And seeing turn toward nationalism around world
Nationalism different patriotism Patriotism love one country pride one country expense country Nationalism vindictive zerosum view world jungle Thats dangerous interdependent world Its even date 70 year ago Weve seen movie end badly
The big lesson especially last six month Brexit imbroglio u internationalist got passionate valuesbased much carrying song heart nationalist nativist The devil cant best tune
