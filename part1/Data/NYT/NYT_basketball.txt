OAKLAND Calif The Golden State Warriors run practice drill Coach Steve Kerr intend tribute even named someone taught great deal He call Lute Olson drill blur activity 3on2 exercise Kerr us get player court
Its good way get little running rhythm shooting said
The Warriors pretty good thing elevated basketball modern art recent season But Kerr help define basketball present help dip past He learned drill 1983 freshman guard University Arizona playing Olson early stage building college powerhouse Kerr ever student already absorbing much could
Olson 84 retired men basketball coach Arizona 2008 influence resonates Not much oddly enough college level late Arizona wellpublicized struggle along rest Pac12 Conference Instead Olsons impact exists largely NBA Warriors particular
Bruce Fraser one Kerrs longtime assistant played Olson 1980s working graduate assistant And Andre Iguodala veteran Warriors forward played Arizona 2002 2004 sought emulate older teammate named Luke Walton
All fundamental Iguodala said Things like footwork body positioning smart player
Walton thankless task coaching Los Angeles Lakers still considered member Warriors extended family serving one Kerrs assistant two season Before Walton joined Warriors 2014 Kerr know well But Olson recommended enough
If came Arizona era knew play game Fraser said And mostly Lute
Olson health issue recent year emphasized basketball basic Each practice began series chest pass Players worked weak hand The Warriors warm launching halfcourt heave slightly le regimented
If Coach Olson walked saw hed shaking head Fraser said Hed think loose
The Warriors still mindful essential though especially training camp dribble around traffic cone throw pass pitchback net configured target If channel Harlem Globetrotters flamboyance rooted bedrock principle
And I think could tie lot back Coach Olson Arizona Fraser said
Kerr played several legendary NBA coach Phil Jackson Gregg Popovich Lenny Wilkens Cotton Fitzsimmons took piece developed style Jerry Marvin former coach Palisades High School Los Angeles made big impression But coach unique approach
I think common thread force personality Kerr said They saw game little differently ran different stuff basing lot personnel But made great coach It great talent developing great culture system talent could flourish
Olson example adapted strength roster He became guardoriented year especially recruited highprofile player like Damon Stoudamire Khalid Reeves Gilbert Arenas Kerr noted one slow guy backcourt Olson starting Arizona
But Olson necessarily trying outwit anyone especially innovative Basketball Kerr said like football mastermind like Bill Belichick lean tactical genius mold New England Patriots dominant NFL team era
Football strategic Kerr said But basketball arent many guy I think historically best coach earth offensive wizard defensive wizard It culture built way team played together style system
It become hackneyed concept sport team crack code demand Olson culture former player say Jason Terry retired NBA guard played Arizona 1995 1999 recalled recruitment He shy young man Olson point firmly established one game top coach sort gravitas intimidated
On second day Terrys official visit Arizona Olson wife Bobbi pancake
These unbelievable pancake Terry analyst Turner Sports said telephone interview That big part recruitment But I also remember kind came put big paw shoulder I jumped He like Nothing scared young fella Its great home And point ease
Olson Terry said first coach never used profanity Olson would glare His face would go red And big paw would shake
But would never yell Terry said He would say name
Above Olson imbued player sense part something larger Before national championship game 1997 two prominent alumnus Kerr Sean Elliott graduated NBA boarded team bus Olson invited address player message simple Do u come could never quite get job done
Terry saw Olson tear eye Arizona went win first national title defeating Kentucky overtime
We knew couldnt let Terry said
With Warriors Kerr definitely swears occasion Ask Draymond Green And NBA college basketball But Kerr still try foster atmosphere collective whole supremely talented part Kerr loathes isolation set He celebrates ball movement And stage team dinner road trip family member welcome
As Pac12 rough day Arizona Coach Sean Miller entwined corruption scandal conference could send one team NCAA tournament Iguodala described Pac12 garbage used colorful word though expressed hope moving forward Kerr diplomatic
Its dry spell said And I really dont know answer
In fact Pac12 national championship since Kerr boarded Arizona team bus back 1997 delivered pregame pep talk But way Warriors chase another title still carrying mantle conference old coach

The Kansas Jayhawks entered postseason wing clipped Having lost two star midseason one NCAA suspension one unspecified personal matter could well sustain doubledigit loss second time 19 season
Yet according Rating Percentage Index statistic typically saturates bracketological prognostication ahead NCAA tournament Selection Sunday reveal Kansas Friday morning topranked men basketball team country higher Kentucky beat Kansas handily January higher Virginia zero loss team named Duke higher even Duke basketball messiah Zion Williamson
So start penciling Kansas one four No 1 seed bracket released Sunday night
Not fast While still find website calculate RPI statistic officially men game The NCAA created nearly four decade ago disowned statistic prominent sport last year
We committee decided RPI kind yesterday news season selection committee chairman Bernard Muir athletic director Stanford said last month
The RPIs replacement firstamongequals rating NCAA Evaluation Tool put Kansas way No 19 Fridays game It shockingly large divergence much closely match No 4 seed Kansas generally expected receive committee considers NET advanced stats winning percentage individual game result even eyeball test
As Kansas show RPIland anymore And difficult find close observer college basketball think good thing
By large eyeballing better RPI measuring good versus bad team ESPN tournament analyst Joe Lunardi said NET
More subtle least important moving RPI NET even acronym seems improvement may heralded shift selection committee philosophical underpinnings The selection committee Division I woman tournament still use RPI
Every year long loud debate come selecting atlarge bid team receive automatic tournament slot virtue winning conference tournament championship The fundamental question In sifting candidate committee pick basis deserving say team better season point simply pick best say team gave indication overall quality
RPI essentially measured wonlost record strength schedule tool deserving NET combine RPIlike input efficiency rating margin victory argument best
Joel Sokol Georgia Tech professor engineering compiles college basketball rating known LRMC noted NET closely tracked advanced rating including KenPoms main rating measure offensive defensive efficiency per possession adjusted opponent strength
Its lot better RPI lot reflective good team Sokol said
Stanfords Muir served several year selection committee pick seed final NCAA men field 68 team week called NET contemporary
Were quite pleased new metric working said last month adding Theres thousand possession occur course year Coming one possession going adjust NET significantly
By contrast RPI really could affected single possession It goodfaith attempt two thing situate team record context strength schedule discourage team running score But meant single bad close loss good close victory could disproportionately sway team rating
And RPIs myopic focus encouraged team simply schedule good opponent good fortune shared majorconference team facing many good opponent league play Worse accounting homecourt advantage sport home team win nearly two three game RPI boosted team could afford schedule nonconference home game tended majorconference team
Depending upon amount money support arena basically isolate rest world least control play play play said Doug Fullerton served selection committee Big Sky Conference commissioner Its havenot situation
Meanwhile discouraging blowout meant ignoring margin victory sport analyst decade generally said better predictor future winning percentage
When played good team didnt get bonus winning 40 winning 1 Sokol said He noted Kansas unlikely 61 record onepossession overtime game season explaining aberrantly high RPI
By contrast NET factor game location Team Value Index NCAA also sort win quadrant based whether came home road neutral court And NET account margin victory although nod sportsmanship stat capped 10 point
I think thats honest attempt try capture point spread would tell without creating incentive someone run score Fullerton said
To see kind team NET favor RPI vice versa consider two bubble squad North Carolina State Arizona State
Despite playing competitive Atlantic Coast Conference Wolfpack dreadful RPI 93rd thanks schedule rated 120thmost difficult according Fridays RealTimeRPI figure That partly result conference slate featuring four game ACCs top three team Duke Virginia North Carolina nonconference schedule began five homecourt gimmes Yet close road loss future low seed Wisconsin Florida State well win likely tournament team Syracuse Auburn North Carolina States NET eminently respectable 33rd
On hand Arizona State classic good RPI team defeated Kansas much middling RPIboosted Pacific12 Conference schedule But much evidence Sun Devils good In RPI No 35 NET No 63 They No 61 KenPoms ranking No 57 Sokols LRMC
Both team expected claim one final atlarge spot Sunday But North Carolina State get Arizona State left surest sign yet Age RPI

After hogging ball team final four possession James leaning runner one could put team ahead blocked Knicks Mario Hezonja waning second For Knicks bound NBA draft lottery since training camp rare chance celebrate For Lakers seemingly hit rock bottom lost Phoenix Suns two week ago another opportunity rev backhoe dig little deeper
We got real stagnant said Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma reduced spectator court late game James tried win
Jamess appearance Garden usually big deal He like light stage grandeur history But postbrunch atmosphere Sundays game buzz linoleum convention indictment two lousy team playing nothing indication perhaps James lost luster season
He moment dunk nolook pas crowd roaring appreciation James finished 33 point 8 assist 6 rebound fairly ordinary game even age 34 chestdeep 16th season
But set impossible standard lategame struggle Knicks emblematic season gone awry He faded badly fourth quarter shooting 4 15 field Hezonja could make Jamess afternoon difficult possible James missed final four fieldgoal attempt
Anytime ball I trying get tired Hezonja said
It hardly worst strategy James dominate ball pressure situation let want How many time come
Like thousand Hezonja said
But season sad anomaly James missed large chunk time groin injury little resuscitate thing returned
In week Jamess streak 13 straight playoff appearance eight straight trip NBA final come end No one expected haul Lakers 3139 mountaintop roster poorly constructed start level dysfunction fairly shocking James already banking offseason
Theres lot great free agent summer James said Not going name name every time I say something organization say something specific person get trouble But opportunity get better
For though James taking hit reputation There Anthony Davis saga seemed erode whatever fragile chemistry team left There Jamess subsequent pledge activate playoff mode merely resulted loss And Sunday James tried win game came empty
Even Walt Frazier Hall Fame guard analyst MSG Network criticized James Sundays broadcast sitting apart teammate end bench early timeout When youre face NBA part team Frazier said
To fair James game time always sits end bench But optic poor James exemplar teambuilding season It easy find fault And sure enough late fourth quarter appeared show little trust teammate
We got ball best player hand tried make make right decision Kuzma said We try live
The Knicks closed game 131 run 14 game season Two win come Lakers James asked bothered
It bother didnt close game James said And competitor I bother I didnt make enough play stretch It bother I didnt even get shot hoop Of course stuff bother
But whats difference record record Two team postseason So there difference
No difference two bad team except James play one And biggest surprise

Occasionally Fall watched Simmons nearby Montverde Academy Koumadje landed coming United States Fall Koumadje briefly overlapped Dakar Koumadje originally Chad high school talked phone via Facebook Their discussion rarely veered basketball Instead commiserated difficulty adjusting life 7 foot tall 4500 mile home
Koumadje like Fall grasp unlikelihood develop freeshooting NBA big man Before senior year high school played pickup game University Southern California Andre Drummond Detroit Pistons It Koumadje said realized effective cemented post

Central Florida Coach Johnny Dawkins former Duke guard played towering center Shawn Bradley Manute Bol NBA hired Falls sophomore year created threeyear plan Increasing mobility stamen came first followed catching ball low learning work double triple team This season Dawkins moved Fall farther perimeter defensively

Hopkins brought rarefied energy Seattle Crazy unpredictable one player described admiringly Hopkins 6foot4 still fit known run drill alongside player He broke nose
Along unbridled enthusiasm passed along everything learned nearly three decade Syracuse story lesson even pugilistic one He teaching Washington textbook championship basketball read Boeheims elbow
But success come aching question When Boeheim 74 ready step Hopkins return upstate New York

Not long graduating 1993 Hopkins returned Syracuse try coaching The year turned Hopkins became Boeheims top assistant ace recruiter He helped reel significant chunk Syracuses 2003 national championship team
Then came 2015 The Orange selfimposed postseason ban response NCAA investigation Boeheim fire Syracuse named Hopkins head coach designate The plan straightforward Boeheim would retire 201718 season Hopkins would take

Bella Alarie become mustsee player Princeton woman basketball team Its something coach Courtney Banghart known rest world finding
Banghart began sense people becoming aware star player recent conversation Chris Young former major league pitcher played basketball baseball Princeton
He go Id pay watch two player college basketball Zion Williamson Bella Alarie Banghart said
Almost every basketball fan know Williamson Dukes top player probably NBAs next top draft pick But Alarie She 6foot4 junior developed player capable lifting Tigers national prominence On Saturday Cornell semifinal Ivy League tournament grabbed eight rebound scored gamehigh 21 point shooting 9 10 field 6847 victory advance final
Observers believe chance something Ivy League player done since Allison Feaster graduated Harvard 1998 represent conference extended WNBA career
This development le dedicated plan series serendipitous choice merged hard work Alarie multitalented twoway player kind sought professional level tower peer growing She remembers bit taller say recall time basketball hand
Her father Mark former Duke NBA player set making sure could play position
I think lot really focusing guard skill Bella Alarie said I think dad knew young age developing skill early would really benefit long run We didnt really know tall I would Im really lucky I kept growing
Her slight build meant high school career National Cathedral School Washington drew interest Ivy League team including Harvard Penn get much letter interest father alma mater Anything beyond playing college radar arrived Princeton
In high school I never really thought someone would achieve thing I far college Alarie said And I getting recruited I really want put emphasis getting really wellrounded college experience The Ivy League I really drawn beginning Princeton Penn Harvard definitely school came
Things began change Alarie Ivy League freshman year honor selected play USA Basketball under19 FIBA World Cup
To make team really proved I could compete best country Alarie said And best world age So I think summer really boosted confidence player also expanded game I learned play another system
Her coach took note turned Alarie true hybrid She used post adding 20 pound frame without forsaking guard skill That make intriguing pro prospect league dominated player like Elena Delle Donne Breanna Stewart size ability play position
Opposing coach noticed
I love Tony Bozzella Seton Hall coach said Alarie 22 point 12 rebound last year Princeton win Seton Hall Reminds Delle Donne Not good yet similar game Obviously great scorer many way awesome rebounder passer great vision supersmart A definite firstround pick
This season missing Princetons first nine game broken arm Alarie putting number seldom seen school She set Ivy Leagues singlegame scoring mark last month 45point outing Columbia process became Princeton player Bill Bradley score least 45
Entering weekend Ivy League tournament Yale Alarie averaging 230 point 107 rebound game shooting 51 percent field range extending beyond arc
On defensive end according Synergy Sports data allowing opponent 0564 point per possession ranked 36th country among 2231 Division I player least 100 defensive possession
Accordingly Princeton 27 without Entering weekend Tigers 202 Alarie Unfortunately opponent broke right arm spent recovery time working aggressively going left making even harder stop
While WNBA team comment Alarie publicly scout executive tracking As one put Shes radar They let coach know
I talk WNBA coach time Banghart said So certainly shes secret WNBA
Princetons program generated pro talent Blake Dietrick Ivy League player year 201415 went play Atlanta Dream last season Leslie Robinson whose father Craig twotime player year Princeton early 1980s drafted Liberty third round last season WNBA draft
Dietrick credited success program whole I would nearly much WNBA interest success team 300 season said referring Princetons regularseason record 201415 But also credited coach working improve player within team context eye longterm success
To Banghart different way would treat highachieving Princeton student
If someone interested finance I connect people think learn Banghart said With Bella thing The positionless better Theres eye helping Princeton there eye best pro chooses So Im thinking big picture deserves Shes earned

In rookie season resembled seismograph Knicks forward Kevin Knox needed performance like Sundays Los Angeles Lakers He scored 19 point array shot slashing basket hitting stepback 3pointer guarded LeBron James finishing finesse driving lefthanded layup
Hello Kevin Knox It good see play well Knicks Coach David Fizdale said Hes bump We know Its matter ball going getting confidence But I really thought came mindset going get rut The way attacking force playing
Knox shot 8 14 field 3 5 3point range Knicks 124123 victory Lakers 14th win dismal season
Id struggling little bit whole team coaching staff confidence Knox said I came work every single day got extra shot I knew I going come streak I wanted make sure I kept shooting
Last year Knicks selected Knox freshman Kentucky first round draft ninth After ankle sprain sidelined start season Knoxs play took December averaged 171 point named Eastern Conference rookie month
Knox 19 hit rookie wall beginning midJanuary 20game stretch shot 318 percent field 277 beyond 3point arc The slump started soon scored 31 point highest total NBA game Philadelphia 76ers
Shortly Knox said still learning adjust demand long NBA schedule 48minute game compared 40 minute college AAU ball
Its totally different said late December Eight minute doesnt seem like lot really Thats whole quarter almost Eight minute long time basketball
To improve fitness Knox extra sprint practice spent time treadmill running spurt 15 minute last two fast could
At various point season Fizdale brought former Knicks great like Bernard King Patrick Ewing Bill Bradley Walt Frazier speak young struggling team The coach Miami Heat assistant coach James played also made point introducing Knox Lakers star Sundays game
King Knicks five season mid1980s known seemingly unstoppable baseline turnaround jump shot focused especially mentoring Knox
In meeting early season Knox studied online video highlight Kings career
He help game every time I talk Knox said Hes kind like wing get basket love transition He kind reminds
Perhaps way around rook
Knox said sought tutor well connecting Chris Bosh Grant Hill Jalen Rose Carmelo Anthony former Kentucky player bit advice trying moment
After Monday night 12892 loss Toronto Knicks 11 game left season meaningless except effect draft The three team lowest win total 14 percent landing No 1 selection June presumably Duke freshman Zion Williamson
The Knicks worst record league 1457 expected lose way one slot even uplifting win Lakers ended Knicks Mario Hezonja blocked shot James waning second
We lot ups down season Knox said afterward It bigtime win first sweep season Its great way win Garden last 10 second one best player ever play game get defensive stop crowd standing yelling
At critical stretch fourth quarter Knicks three rookie court Knox center Mitchell Robinson guard Allonzo Trier plus guard Kadeem Allen called Westchester developmental team forward Lance Thomas longesttenured Knick
Theres process need happen growth making sure young guy getting experience need order good league Thomas said A lot young guy dont get play especially extended minute first year Its learning experience young guy Our goal fasttrack
Knox sixth league among rookie minute played per game 28 despite shooting subpar 364 percent field struggling weakside defense He averaging 123 point 43 rebound
Even Fizdale never considered sending Knox Westchester work game anonymity G League team already like glorified G League team Fizdale told reporter last week Because rookie played substantial minute season said thought better take knock best
Such James Sunday Torontos Kawhi Leonard Monday
Welcome league kid Fizdale said This This I wanted Take lump Later career one remember stuff guy beating kid This good

Maybe never going win championship season even LeBron James supposed bad What happened

The arrival LeBron James latest succession superstar import supposed halt longest period suffering Los Angeles Lakers California history
What James Lakers experienced instead remembered disappointing season Jamess career extend stubborn playoff drought flummoxed NBAs glamorous franchise
Not even Jamess presence could prevent sixth straight missed postseason new Lakers mere day mathematically eliminated playoff entering Sundays visit Madison Square Garden face Knicks The Lakers remember missed playoff four time first 53 season relocating Minneapolis 196061 season
So much Hollywood fairy tale
Perhaps expectation team unrealistically high given modest quality Jamess supporting cast Year 1 Lakerland debut never supposed veer far offscript onceinageneration player What follows breakdown thing fell apart six stage
Without warning July 1 2018 first night NBA free agency James announced 39word news release signing fouryear 154 million contract Lakers
Yet ensuing celebration last even 24 hour
On July 2 Golden State boldly swiped Lakers thunder signing former AllStar big man DeMarcus Cousins bargain deal The Lakers spent next week scouring league best player willing sign oneyear contract thereby preserving salarycap flexibility summer 2019 planned pursuit AllStar sidekick James
The problem Magic Johnson Rob Pelinka Lakers nascent frontoffice power duo signed slew nonshooters shall say mercurial personality group prompted instant secondguessing
The Lakers countered skepticism insisting playmaker playofftested veteran rather shooting specialist could open space floor would ease LeBrons burden potentially even match well mighty Warriors see signees little hush toldyouso crowd JaVale McGee veteran center initially exceeded expectation quartet Rajon Rondo Lance Stephenson Kentavious CaldwellPope Michael Beasley proved collectively ineffective feared
Perhaps known going usual LeBron season fight broke number Lakers Houston Rockets Jamess first home game Staples Center
And tension never really let
After eight game five loss Johnson summoned Coach Luke Walton pointed lecture Lakers sluggish start The team legendary pointguardturnedteam president never intended meeting detail leak news medium promptly nosecrets world NBA
Johnson immediately tried play suggestion Waltons job already jeopardy interview The Los Angeles Times would go proclaiming Walton going finish season unless something drastic happens wont
Walton certainly blameless Lakers struggle His lineup rotation responsibility LAs worrisome drop No 22 leaguewide offensive efficiency routinely questioned Management furthermore said dismayed Waltons refusal hire seasoned former head coach top assistant something young coach Walton 38 frequently
Yet public nature heat Walton took front office made Johnson look impatient worse ramped pressure everyone Lakers locker room especially coach even made Thanksgiving With two year left fiveyear deal Walton widely expected shoved toasty seat good season end
What classified best day Lakers season considered box score also bound remembered season low point
The Lakers went Oakland Christmas Day game anticipated television time slot regularseason calendar throttled twotime defending champion Warriors The 127101 rout capped 189 surge nudged LAs record 2014 good promising fourth dauntingly deep Western Conference
But James strained left groin stretched retrieve loose ball third quarter The Lakers gradually pulled away without James optimistically posted Twitter next day dodged bullet BackInNoTime hashtag injury turned serious ever sustained
James eventually missed 17 game No previous injury ever sidelined longer eight game lost back injury 201415 The Lakers went 611 without James even accounting misstep LeBron went rightly point suddenly losing star biggest blow team playoff hope
It remains unclear BackInNoTime turned six week sideline James An inevitability given age 34 The byproduct Lakers playing much faster pace LeBrons Cleveland team A freak occurrence
Maybe combination factor
Whats clear though Lakers overall poor health consistently hurt
The Lakers starter 615 since Jan 19 Lonzo Ball begun impress James starting point guard sustained serious ankle injury And there
Tyson Chandler veteran center made impact defensively joining team Nov 6 dealing neck ailment Josh Hart promising secondyear guard plagued tendinitis left knee month And Brandon Ingram swingman tantalizing potential scorer missed several game ankle shoulder problem ruled rest season recently deep venous thrombosis
In real time 11 day elapsed New Orleans forward Anthony Daviss trade request going public Jan 28 league Feb 7 trade deadline But surely felt like eternity Lakers quartet starlet Ingram Ball Hart Kyle Kuzma
Especially since fallout continuing
From minute James arrived Hollywood Lakers made unsuccessful trade run Paul George Kawhi Leonard known team would try trade Davis meant four LAs top young player destined hear name trade speculation Yet leaguewide consensus Davis would made available least 2019 offseason theoretically giving starlet opportunity build something James maybe even change management mind looking externally LeBrons superstar sidekick
But Daviss trade request changed everything Rich Paul LeBrons agent longtime friend became Daviss agent September widely perceived made trade request Daviss behalf get Los Angeles A seemingly ceaseless stream leaked Lakers offer thereafter irreparably fractured locker room matter hard Paul pushed back narrative
Nor team fully move trade drama everyone know front office back phone New Orleans soon trying beat Boston Celtics package Davis Pelicans start fielding offer anew
A Feb 12 road loss Atlanta Hawks Lakers fourth five game entering AllStar break lowered record 2829 James emerged break insisting would shift playoff mode far earlier normal Its activated LeBron promised Lakers promptly lost road game Davisless Pelicans draftminded Memphis Grizzlies hopebuilding home win Houston Rockets
The season effectively ended March 2 Phoenix Lakers lost Suns team midst 118 funk The defeat meant LA fallen five league six team currently sub400 winning percentage Chicago exception The loss soon followed announcement Ball Ingram would held Lakers remaining game Jamess minute would reduced
James held Fridays game Detroit Pistons via increasingly popular leaguewide synonym rest load management LeBrons load course become lighter April May June anyone expected

Amid breathless chatter day Zion Williamson Duke favored win NCAA Tournament begin next week easy forget Villanova reigning champion remain dethroned
For everybody doesnt think Villanovas still one elite team country wait till play Providence Coach Ed Cooley said team lost Wildcats Big East tournament Thursday
This season transition Villanova many way lot like last came Despite lost four player NBA last season NCAA title team Villanovas second championship past three year Wildcats Big East regularseason crown fifth time six year A win week conference tournament Madison Square Garden would fourth five year Two Wildcats guard Phil Booth forward Eric Paschall unanimous selection allBig East team week third starter forward Saddiq Bey made allfreshman squad
Yet expert list top contender lift NCAA championship trophy often start Duke star freshman Williamson R J Barrett Blue Devils Atlantic Coast Conference rival Virginia North Carolina perpetually competitive Kentucky topranked Gonzaga Those list rarely run deep enough include Villanova
We see Coach Jay Wright said And always tell getting attention right fine But thinking good
Wrights expectation season adjusted even began Entering last year NCAA Tournament Wright expected lose two best player Mikal Bridges Jalen Brunson NBA draft But Wildcats beat Michigan final two underclassman forward Omari Spellman guard Donte DiVincenzo decided turn professional well
Had Spellman DiVincenzo returned Villanova probably would favored repeat national champion Even one come back Villanova would among favorite Instead four player selected first 33 pick draft
That changed calculus Wright In recent year Villanova built success redshirting player last year roster featured seven including Bridges Spellman DiVincenzo taken year learn Wrights system team method without competing game But departure four key player one offseason forced Wright adapt fly
To compensate sudden lack depth Wright something rarely He added graduate transfer former Albany guard Joe Cremo offered experience scoring backcourt And told Booth Eric Paschall two redshirt senior would expect
The rebuilt Wildcats struggled time Villanova lost nine game season losing four last year It opened season 27point home loss Michigan game billed national championship rematch later endured two set backtoback loss recent threegame losing streak
Still Booth Paschall steadied ship Wildcats leading scorer
I couldnt proud Wright said adding They really difficult task program year lot new guy Not leading patient teaching
Along Booth Paschall Wright rely heavily sophomore Collin Gillespie seamlessly taken point guard duty held Brunson Hes sophomore Wright said kind treating like senior
Regardless happens weekend next week though Villanovas future look bright Wright 57 one two active Division I men coach eligible year basketball hall fame widely expected get And new talent already way The lure two recent national title helped Wright lock perhaps country best recruiting class 2019
Whether Villanova team match success recent predecessor player arrive remains seen The Wildcats beat fourthseeded Xavier 7167 overtime Friday night advance Saturdays conference title game Seton Hall defeated Marquette semifinal
So Wright team might posing trophy await NCAA seed Sunday night

The Cavaliers lost opening game last season tournament This year team top seed might even better
By The New York Times
Virginia back No 1 seed tournament experience get better last year Cavaliers became first No 1 men seed lose No 16 But selection committee Virginia favor A date fourthseeded Kansas State 258 could await regionals No 2seeded Tennessee 295 dangerous experienced team one want play How tough South Wisconsin always tough March No 5 seed Villanova Big East champion winner two past three national championship sixth seed The good news Virginia It shut almost anyone The Cavaliers country stingiest defense allowing 551 point game
1 Virginia 293 v 16 GardnerWebb 2311
8 Mississippi 2012 v 9 Oklahoma 1913
5 Wisconsin 2310 v 12 Oregon 2312
4 Kansas State 258 v 13 UC Irvine 305
3 Purdue 239 v 14 Old Dominion 268
6 Villanova 259 v 11 St Marys 2211
7 Cincinnati 286 v 10 Iowa 2211
2 Tennessee 295 v 15 Colgate 2410
Lets clear You could taken Virginias three best player away last year openinground game versus University Maryland Baltimore County Cavaliers top overall seed still would probably favored 16thseeded Retrievers
But nonetheless worth pointing Virginias historic loss UMBC fact occur without ACCs sixth man year DeAndre Hunter redshirt freshman reliably offered 20 minute 10 point floorstretching offense bench
And would well recall year second college season Hunter blossomed stalwart start every game average 151 point 5 rebound 21 assist He decidedly healthy Virginia turn attention year No 16 matchup GardnerWebb Runnin Bulldogs
It sucked last year Hunter said Friday night shortly Virginia defeated Florida State ACC tournament semifinal But itll different year
He seemed become OK stillsimmering Seminoles loss spoke
Ill definitely able play added Looking forward
What Hunter went high school Philadelphia chose Virginia Maryland Villanova offer size position He nominal point guard listed 6 foot 7 225 pound
Virginia Coach Tony Bennett took care last year make excuse team historic defeat But course discussing squad accepting national coach year award note Hunter added subtraction subtracted
We pretty good year playing smaller team Bennett said I think thats always little bit Kryptonite year I think addressed took step right direction I think DeAndre Hunter flexibility When wasnt available NCAA tournament effective
That inoculation big team could prove relevant coming week In regional semifinal Cavaliers could well face fourthseeded Kansas State whose coach Bruce Weber defensive mastermind fifthseeded Wisconsin size around In fact per KenPomcom team fourth thirdbest defense college basketball
On hand Hunter Virginia fifthrated defense No 2 offense Which mean Cavaliers match well assuming make past GardnerWebb course MARC TRACY
Oregon probably kept deserving team knocking Washington 20 point win Pacific12 tournament Mired bottom league standing earlier year Oregon enters tournament eightgame winning streak In 39 year coaching Ive never seen team grow much fast Ducks Coach Dana Altman said ANDREW DAS
Old Dominions BJ Stith Conference USA player year started career Virginia father Bryant Cavaliers career scoring leader He stayed one year transferring Old Dominion Bryant Stith assistant since 2013 ANDREW DAS

With Seton Hall trailing Villanova 2 point closing second Big East tournament final Saturday night Pirates Coach Kevin Willard ball right wanted hand junior guard Myles Powell
Powell freed shot potential goahead 3pointer would given Seton Hall lead perhaps even title sent fraction long The ball hit back rim Wildcats ran clock Willard Powell didnt regret thing

His week began 31point effort dominant win Georgetown one point singlehandedly outscored Hoyas 2925 He followed 22point outing semifinal upset Marquette added 25 point 5 rebound 4 assist 3 steal loss Villanova final
Powering Pirates though nothing new Powell Trenton native averaging 229 point 41 rebound 29 assist expected year Seton Hall The Pirates lost four senior starter last season picked finish eighth league preseason poll instead Seton Hall wound third knocked Marquette Villanova late year earned fourth straight trip NCAA tournament
Willard credit Powell continuing leadership tradition established senior left last season Khadeen Carrington Angel Delgado Desi Rodriguez Ismael Sanogo But shooting hasnt hurt either Powell made 103 3pointers shooting 363 percent behind arc His supreme confidence team bonus
Myles Powell best shooter country period Jimmy Salmon director New Jersey AAU team said Powell committed Seton Hall 2015 His game transcend next level
Now Powell headed third straight NCAA tournament If performance Madison Square Garden indication Seton Halls opponent handful
We play anybody country Powell said We beat Marquette twice Nova last week top two team conference And today gave Nova hard fight We know play anybody country playing basketball ADAM ZAGORIA

SEATTLE Howard Schultz faced fullcourt press trouble 2006 began That Seattle SuperSonics lousy worst season 20 year beginning
Though Sonics storied NBA franchise league championship 1979 attendance Seattle arena along point scored revenue earned As team lead owner Mr Schultz facing unrest fan partner alike At time Starbucks coffee company built global giant hit bad patch first ripple Great Recession began rise flood tide
You dont basketball fan know problem Mr Schultz able fix
The Sonics longer exist sold Mr Schultzs group pivotal year later moved Oklahoma City renamed even memorabilia packed away Now Mr Schultz mull running president independent candidate path moment say lot handle adversity uncertainty grasped nettle local politics Sonics flailing according 20 people observed befriended worked year
His basketball legacy left many Seattle outraged day believing Mr Schultz either duplicitous duped others Yet action Starbucks including raft innovation introduced recession like health insurance baristas became stuff adoring Harvard Business School case study In Fortune magazine ranking Starbucks fifthmost admired company world
The common thread deeply familiar people city Mr Schultz called home since early 1980s echoed talk entering politics kind idealistic righteousness combined obvious conviction ability insight All worked like magic wand Seattle except didnt
Theres question built amazing business one Seattle benefited one worldwide reach said Greg Nickels Democrat second term Seattles mayor 2006
The Sonics episode I think different Mr Nickels added I think got discovered thought going
Mr Schultz 65 selfmade billionaire grew public housing Brooklyn said interview conducted request Starbucks decided whether seek White House set deadline A selfdescribed lifelong Democrat Mr Schultz said thought Democrats veering far left President Trump Republicans far right hunger centrist candidacy like one might put
But also said repeatedly recent speech around nation promoting new memoir would run became convinced candidacy could aid Mr Trumps reelection
Indeed announcement January seriously considering running brought outcry many Democrats feared split vote The president chimed tweeting Mr Schultz never sought public office doesnt gut Warren Buffett called Schultz candidacy mistake
As rule American politics independent fail get elected Since Civil War four minorparty candidate president mustered least 10 percent vote Ross Perot George Wallace Robert La Follette Theodore Roosevelt Roosevelt Republican turned Bull Moose candidate 1912 election couldnt win despite popular president year earlier But even getting le 10 percent make difference Ralph Nader showed 2000 election put George W Bush White House Electoral College victory even though Al Gore outgoing vice president popular vote
For part Mr Schultz belief independent president could powerful mandate governing refutation voter bitter divisive politics revenge paralyzed Washington The example could done would turn draw surge likeminded independent candidate would reshape Congress added
The current trajectory demonstrates evidence broken system Mr Schultz said Im looking situation realizing large majority Americans agree
If Mr Schultz run Seattle experience combined back story selfmade success would narrative tell sell Starbucks started different company Mr Schultz said culture defines Pacific Northwest The Sonics failed Seattle story Mr Schultz apologized In universe ventisize place success failure
When Mr Schultz organized investor group buy SuperSonics 2001 took high road rhetoric Sounding like civic patron city loved grubby business moneymaking much afterthought promised treat team kind sacred civic trust
This ownership group get involved make profit said one point testifying Washington State Legislature We wanted passionate people sport passionate people community
That language imagery came back haunt aftermath team demise
Schultz became pariah said Gary Washburn former Seattle sportswriter cover NBA The Boston Globe
In February 2006 Mr Schultz drove State Capitol Olympia plunked front microphone woodpaneled Senate meeting room repeated considered threat might sell Sonics didnt get 200 million public money renovation arena
He said Sonics losing money terrible uncompetitive arena lacking profitable addons franchise like restaurant store Public money lavished sport Seattle past year pointed new play space Mariners baseball team Seahawks football team It time bestow love NBA Mr Schultz said
It go well The Sonics bailout bill even come final vote The political appeal financing athletic venue faded 2000 dotcom economic bust ballot measure aimed reducing taxpayer money professional sport gaining favor even Mr Schultz testified Initiative 91 called approved fall 74 percent majority
Several people Legislature time said Mr Schultz never involved politics lobbying treated like outsider never appeared understand network informal alliance stood way Calls coming legislative office people connected city sport team saying didnt much like idea financing lot expensive new skybox seat
The Mariners Seahawks people terribly encouraging several back channel sort front channel stuff going said James McIntire Democratic state representative time later served two term state treasurer
Art Thiel longtime columnist sportswriter covered Sonics story said Mr Schultz simply didnt understand state capital He thought could pro sport owner sort thing could successful business owner either charm opposition bully said He got neither done
Barely five month hitting wall legislature Mr Schultz made good warning announcing coowners sold team group based Oklahoma moved renamed Thunder
Mr Schultz call decision one major regret life
My biggest mistake still reverberates Mr Schultz wrote recent oped piece The Seattle Times In book elaborates happened Almost everyone blamed initial denial I realized right I squandered public trust I bought
A longtime friend Mr Schultzs Howard Behar former vice president Starbucks said Mr Schultz learned experience warned advance straying world knew might dangerous
When bought company I quote local newspaper Seattle I said No good come I think he nut Mr Behar recalled And I right No good came
The storied name Seattle business world roll tongue world Amazon Boeing Eddie Bauer Microsoft REI Starbucks And Microsoft associated cofounder Bill Gates Paul Allen Amazon founder Jeff Bezos Mr Schultz Mr Coffee father Frappuccino coffee size butchered Italian The venti extralarge mean 20 Italian nod espresso culture Mr Schultz fell love trip Italy 1983
Mr Schultz handed leadership rein company last year came Seattle wife Sheri 1982 take job marketing director Starbucks modest local seller coffee bean Only five year later organized investor group buy company built two stint chief executive retail giant nearly 30000 store around world 380000 employee
But like Seattle vast wealth abundant homelessness leftleaning social environmental policy income tax considerable allotment billionaire Schultz legacy mixed
At first Seattle appearance announcing presidential consideration protester gathered outside downtown theater promoting new memoir The protester waved sign venti ego failed billionaire politician audience inside cheered almost every whispered hint presidential run
In charitable civic work Schultz Family Foundation force homeless advocacy working shelter group youthtraining center Seattle datadriven approach moving homeless family street quickly stable housing
The foundation piloted something proved worked said Marty Hartman executive director Marys Place nonprofit shelter provider received 45 million Starbucks Schultz foundation
But measure civic engagement like bothering vote Mr Schultz le involved Of 40 election held since 2003 could participated Seattle resident voted 12 time according King County record
Im remiss course I vote local election know I travel much Mr Schultz said interview though quickly added never missed chance vote president

DURHAM NC Political leader one progressive part South dreamed two decade ambitious plan transit line connecting Durham home Duke University nearby Chapel Hill Funds pledged rendering drawn
But recent day Duke labored turn around reputation privileged cloister brought plan shrieking halt It unilaterally rejected proposed lightrail route would cut across property And resulting moral outrage felt strong enough power train
Representative GK Butterfield North Carolina Democrat said appalled university decision Wib Gulley former mayor Durham compared moment Duke called police gas beat student amid civil right protest 1969
And Kevin Primus former manager Duke men basketball team said rejection lightrail plan justified school reputation among AfricanAmericans like still occasionally refer plantation
You poor workingclass black people would like get better employment another location whole community collaborating make happen Duke veto power said Mr Primus 45 member local transit affordable housing group headed Mr Gulley
So go one bitter impassioned transportation battle country appears two mind rail transit future role culture largely dominated car While American city like Seattle Denver Los Angeles embraced new transit plan make extensive use train recent effort stymied clumsy politics high price tag resistance strictly ideological notinmybackyard variety
Last May voter increasingly congested city Nashville voted 52 billion transit plan would included light rail And California struggled realize ambition highspeed train connecting Los Angeles San Francisco despite statewide Democratic Party hegemony
In South another closely watched decision rail transit come Tuesday voter populous Atlanta suburb Gwinnett County former Republican stronghold trending Democratic decide whether tax expand Marta regional rail transit system county first time Similar plan rejected Gwinnett voter past
Duke official said opposed light rail general specific project But school liberal critic many proud Duke graduate sounded almost betrayed university opposition seeing anathema Dukes call use knowledge service society
How critic wondered could one world greatest university one produced many liberal intelligentsia run region dead set big bold green idea like lightrail line
Advocates train insist proposed 177mile service could combat gridlock linking Durham Chapel Hill home University North Carolina would provide access three major hospital well historically black North Carolina Central University Durham
They also envision train social justice engine offering cheap reliable transportation working people scrape cooking cleaning legion college student Research Triangle area includes two college town Raleigh state capital
Indeed recent day regional transit authority GoTriangle tried unsuccessfully persuade Duke donate land project proponent emphasized history towngown tension working people Durham County majoritynonwhite community 27 percent child live poverty elite private institution admit black student early 1960s
Given long history fraught relation many lowincome Durham resident Duke University supporting project would brilliant way Duke reassert good community said letter Vincent Price president university signed two dozen member university Nicholas School Environment faculty
But Duke official adamant objection project serious insurmountable They said construction vibration electromagnetic interference train might affect sensitive research equipment Dukes sprawling medical campus train line would skirt And concerned project impact underground utility serve medical center threat new lawsuit
In official rejection administrator said project proposed would jeopardize community health public safety future viability enterprise
At packed campus meeting recently people audience appeared favor train snapping finger assent speaker questioned Dukes wisdom Drew Shindell earth science professor noted taxpayer Durham Orange county approved transit sale tax train support major local government body
Outside meeting Claire Wang 20 environmental study major Rhodes scholar copresident Duke Climate Coalition passing information sheet If Duke killed plan said could thwart Durham official broader progressive vision growing rapidly gentrifying city
Many city plan surrounding sustainable development poverty alleviation affordable housing centered lightrail project said
Duke official bristled suggestion school insensitive need neighbor They pointed increasingly diverse student body university embrace 15 minimum wage major program supporting Durhams neighborhood public school public health
Still critic wondered whether Duke using stated concern excuse hidden worry train Like many rail project one imperfect number opponent besides university
The proposed line would go regional airport example Raleigh although future plan heavyrail connection capital The cost lightrail line borne local state federal taxpayer ballooned beyond 3 billion
John Morris member Chapel Hill resident group opposes train said new bus would cheaper quicker put place

A dozen year ago University Washington barred athletic coach contact anyone admission department
With move seems prescient two new administrator supervising athletics sought allay concern coach could put undue pressure admission personnel The change also brought oversight athletics case committee senior faculty member dean university representative
The previous arrangement said Philip Ballinger associate vice provost overseeing admission didnt sufficient transparency didnt enough eye
The leeway coach get recruiting long point discussion higher education circle But federal investigator last week revealed broad admission cheating scandal number college began asking hard question evaluate athletic applicant oversee chosen coach recommend admission
In prosecutor described biggest case admission fraud investigated 50 people accused scheme involved paying bribe coach people monitor admission test order fraudulently get child wealthy patron nation elite college
Some student accepted recruited athlete even though play sport described application They gained advantage widespread practice allocating certain number admission spot athlete might get otherwise
This process followed decade pursuit competitive team burnish university reputation inspire alumnus loyalty often help fundraising
Now fraud case sent thunderbolt higher education community
Every college president America called athletic director morning admission fraud story broke asked How make sure doesnt happen school said Bill Martin athletic director University Michigan 2000 retirement 2010 And certain athletic director smart enough call president first insist going start verifying status every admitted recruited athlete
Indeed Yale University FBI investigator say longtime woman soccer coach accepted hundred thousand dollar facilitate admission recruit actually play soccer university president Peter Salovey announced late last week new oversight policy already put place The Yale athletic director begin reviewing every proposed recruit credential admission recruited athlete fail make team arrive receive close scrutiny university statement said
A broad overhaul athletic admission system Division I highest level NCAA competition level college scheme compete overdue according several athletic administrator interviewed recent day
Battles bluechip recruit football basketball already tend heavily scrutinized In upper echelon sport money changing hand coach recruit way around
But lowerprofile sport like crew volleyball tennis soccer often called Olympic sport room bribe exploitation And common route fraud designate phony athletic prospect recruited walkon In nearly every case counterfeit athletic credential cited last week indictment Stanford Texas Yale prospective athlete appeared filling nebulous role recruited walkon
Such applicant even assured spot team But often list five 20 athlete varies sport sport coach permitted submit admission department
The two daughter actress Lori Loughlin charged connection fraud case last week passed crew recruit despite never competed sport according federal prosecutor
That choice sport may accident In sport like woman crew roster balloon 125 athlete many team score recruited walkons Such large roster help college comply federal equality law balancing number male athlete football
When roster big like woman crew I could see would possible coach slip unqualified person recruited walkon said Martin added Michigan annually audited team roster
The recruitment athlete sport may even bigger factor admission process college NCAAs lowest tier Division III athletic scholarship forbidden
Division III also largest tier nearly 450 institution including many country selective small liberal art college acceptance rate low 15 percent These college might field many 30 team enrollment small 2000 varsity athlete many afforded advantage admission making 30 percent 45 percent student body
These small college like largest one also give preferential treatment applicant excel music art host skill There also allowance student leastpopulated state
Admissions filling different bucket said Wendy Smith athletic director Haverford College highly rated institution near Philadelphia And athlete right We way gaming system They absolutely par academically
The cost fielding successful sport team ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often lead troubling conflict interest
In Ivy League example coach responsible fundraising bridge gap support college true price tag competing successfully That lead uncomfortable decision composing team especially since athlete family often become leading donor
You family give 25000 going play daughter said Paul Wardlaw woman tennis coach Brown University 14 year
The whole scandal interesting human nature take easy route said systematic issue contributing
At many elite institution notion recruited athlete granted unfair advantage palpable
Cameron Green tight end football team Northwestern University accepts 13 percent applicant conceded several high school classmate play sport applied Northwestern rejected
Its easier athlete get I know thats hard regular student said Green senior plan play football final year eligibility A lot kid I knew confused I got didnt know end day school look demographic piece paper decides admit even meet
The high percentage recruited athlete college particularly smaller one consequence odds institutional ambition diverse student body
Because success youth sport today often come easily affluent family spend copiously private instruction roster college team become predominantly white nearly 80 percent small school
In end higher education community believe last week admission fraud scandal embarrassing lesson policy change need made nevertheless creating false impression state admission procedure American college
There notion admission competitive cesspool said Michael Reilly executive director American Association College Registrars Admissions Officers In fact Reilly added campus nationwide fail meet enrollment goal But segment thats highly competitive created completely different dynamic If I campus Id sitting saying Lets rethink

Well Duke Virginia Gonzaga Kentucky Texas Tech every No 1 No 2 No 3 seed game Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Dukes two final basket scored two star freshman Williamson R J Barrett Sometimes cant fight City Hall
Such theme season tournament first weekend first two round There school thought perfect tournament would feature favorite winning After exactly point seed But casual fan fact especially casual fan know unlikely win stunning loss lie heart NCAA tournament broad appeal
It second time top 12 seed among 16 regional semifinalist since bracket expanded 64 team 1985 according tournament medium coordinator David Worlock Two No 4 seed also remain second time
If trust selection committee seedings consider Fourteen top 15 team KenPomcoms ranking last Monday game began final 16 So 15 top 18
In interesting twist No 9 seed No 10 seed went 71 first round faced eighth seventhseeded team But upset accountant could love
Similarly Oregons defeat Wisconsin first round technically No 12vsNo 5 upset Ducks coming run Pacific12 Conference tournament title several oddsmakers cast game pick em
Only No 11 Ohio States 6259 win No 6 Iowa State No 13 CaliforniaIrvines 7064 defeat No 4 Kansas State qualified kind classic firstround upset aficionado unpredictable NCAA tournament cherish Both lost second round
One thing mean outofnowhere deeprun team order Gonzaga 1999 Virginia Commonwealth 2011 LoyolaChicago last year Has someone cleaning eraser Because sure feel chalky

It could bracket trending favoriteheavy direction tournament two year ago notably chalky well It also could tendency ebb flow year since 1985 four top seed made Final Four 2008
In predicting happens next could worse look 2009 bracket also one three top seed conference eerily also featured among 16 regional semifinalist 12 top seed two No 4 seed No 5 seed No 12 seed Pacific12 known Pacific10
In year four top seed advanced regional final Two made Final Four one lasted national title game
The top overall seed Louisville lost regional final No 2 seed quadrant Michigan State This year No 2 seed quadrant top overall seed Duke Michigan State
Those Spartans made national championship game lose last top seed ranked third overall tournament selector North Carolina This year equivalent No 1 seed rated third overall side bracket North Carolina

LEXINGTON Ky Reid Travis needed play one year college basketball
A Stanford senior Travis working privately last spring anticipation NBA draft But invitation combine never came A team work message clear would among NBAs precious 60 draft pick
Six foot 8 inch solid used playing near rim Travis said told needed add another dimension game versatile become better passer decrease turnover become athletic Given suddenly decide whether stay Stanford graduate student pursue graduate degree basketball somewhere else
Follow live coverage NCAA tournament
And thus created different kind oneanddone college basketball top finishing school John Caliparis Kentucky famed lair ubertalented highschoolers play one NBAmandated season game entering draft
Granted Im four five year older guy Travis said last month sitting lounge outside locker room Kentuckys practice facility But I year similar
Traviss decision striking decade Calipari popular host raw freshman rather seasoned senior His modus operandi Kentucky accept without apology best 17 18yearolds July coach send NBA following June Since Calipari arrived Lexington 2009 Kentucky averaged three firstround pick year freshman The team also reached four Final Fours captured national title
Enter Travis twotime AllPac12 firstteamer turned 23 November He injured one season Stanford medical redshirt left one year eligibility But leaving Stanford walked graduation class majored Science Technology Society course study attracts many techminded arrive Palo Alto dream staying Silicon Valley college
That moving Kentucky also made perfect sense A highly recruited prospect Minneapolis five year ago Travis one year left sought school could help get wanted basketball player
Youre playing 30something game season youre practice almost 200 day said Travis analyzing problem like engineer
So I go Im playing pro every day practice added I felt like best platform everyone potentially pro position thats youre training night thats youre practicing thats youre hanging eating Everyone mindset trying professional
The jury still whether sufficiently improved draft stock Two NBA frontoffice executive declined named NBA rule ban public discussion prospect delivered mixed review One predicted Travis drafted argued thanks Traviss time Kentucky played way low midsecond round
Calipari Travis confined mostly paint But James Clark private coach worked Travis last summer said Travis improved shooting point could play stretch four valuable kind power forward create space offense serving threat score away rim
I also think people seeing strong Clark added Hes smart basketball doesnt lot turnover
At Kentucky 276 face Abilene Christian first round NCAA men tournament Thursday Jacksonville Fla Travis emerged starter key force near basket Because playing fewer minute starstocked Wildcats pergame statistic previous two season although block total skyrocketed impact nonetheless powerful
Calipari credited Travis wrestling Grant Williams resident bruiser rival Tennessee draw Kentuckys victory fellow No 2 seed last month As prove Caliparis point Tennessee next meeting team Travis sprained knee Tennessee also rubber match 4 point Southeastern Conference tournament Travis back court probably full strength
For Calipari education Travis task unusual familiar
Heres kid work like need little extra stuff able go reach dream appealed Calipari said interview office
At one point Calipari referred Travis good kid scolded calling Travis kid
The two bonded last fall contentious hearing Brett Kavanaughs Supreme Court nomination
We talked Supreme Court stuff going said Calipari politics junkie Havent able last eight nine year
One night team dinner Calipari told Travis thought Senator Amy Klobuchar Minnesota played prominent role hearing might make compelling Democratic presidential candidate Travis agreed family Klobuchars family friend went high school senator daughter Abigail Bessler Klobuchar entered presidential race February
Travis spend next year trying hard earn NBA spot
Calipari optimistic Travis shoot create dribble score Hes going one guy league want locker room want team toughness guard anybody Calipari said
The process might take time lucky break improvement combination three Periods frustration seem likely
It also easy see Travis eventually ending business school He aspires athletic administration Stanford took time get know athletic director Bernard Muir
That something think later There immediate task fifthyear senior Thursday morning National Invitation Tournament championship yet play NCAA tournament game
Ive happy I came Travis said recently I really came March

College sport upside But sheer scale silly
By David Leonhardt
Opinion Columnist
This article part David Leonhardts newsletter You sign receive weekday
At 1115 local time Des Moines morning March Madness begin earnest The men basketball team University Minnesota University Louisville playing It first 16 game today another 80 men woman game take place next several day
In couple recent newsletter Ive written downside college sport big one Today I want talk upside college sport might able achieve better balance
I assume many filled March Madness bracket friend family colleague Those bracket give excuse fun together Some also fortunate enough big rooting interest one team still playing Maybe youll watch game together exchange nervous text game final moment Maybe youll end jumping around house joy point next couple week kid sibling
Listen The Argument podcast every Thursday morning Ross Douthat Michelle Goldberg David Leonhardt
College sport bring people lot joy As one college roommate texted last week way objecting recent criticism sport Im happier basketball team good Hes got point Sports create shared experience way activity country
This communal function mean college good reason treat athlete differently applicant Yes college make sure theyre admitting athlete academic preparation graduate But I understand basketball player representing University Minnesota today dont necessarily need academic qualification student oboist journalist Minnesota Those athlete bring something campus student
Why world
But important remember something else Most college sport dont look anything like basketball They dont bring lot people together Their crowd small They dont many spillover benefit part university They exist largely benefit athlete make different many extracurricular activity
And sport often disproportionately played white relatively welloff student They dont add much diversity campus Only 4 percent male college lacrosse player black Justin Wolfers University Michigan noted Only 5 percent fencer In golf share 2 percent In water polo 1 percent
Yet college treat athlete sport entirely different specie applicant The athlete dont need nearly strong application student
Because many sport exist share athlete college shockingly high Roughly 20 percent onefifth entering class Ivy League university leading small liberal art college recruited athlete Jonathan Cole top former official Columbia University college athlete written Why world school using 20 percent slot recruited athlete The answer Cole explains sport become kind arm race
In recent newsletter I mentioned one five student Williams College western Massachusetts athlete according outside estimate That turn wrong conservative Williams high end distribution 30 percent student recruited athlete according college
Cole right situation doesnt make sense I fully aware fencer golfer water polo player athlete work extremely hard But many student participate extracurricular activity superior academic record Those student often rejected make room athlete The problem special treatment many athlete receiving
In better system college would substantially shrink number athlete recruit Each would keep modest number sport split equally men woman would recruit athlete still give huge admission bonus
These wouldnt team college fielded But sport would follow classic scholarathlete model The member team would longer receive extraspecial treatment admission process They would student happened athlete And would compete team filled similar athlete
Is college brave enough move direction

But Byrd staff started getting wordofmouth preseason workout Byrd said Friday telephone interview Morant solid He best player league heard In fact season would NBA draft pick Make NBA lottery pick
It hard believe Byrd said third wheel team best really
He guy Byrd added You knew didnt want open floor break You knew could see floor pas ball But went strong screen pickandrolls Belmont dared Morant shoot
Now Byrd believer along everyone else Morant led Murray State conference championship Belmont month Morant emerged college basketball exciting player side Dukes Zion Williamson transcendent freshman may well turn player taken ahead Morant Junes NBA draft Morant eighth Division I scoring 244 point game first assist 102
On Thursday Morant led 12thseeded Racers 284 8364 thrashing fifthseeded Marquette Hartford NCAA tournament first round contributing 17 point 11 rebound 16 assist first men tournament tripledouble since 2012 He followed 28 point 5 rebound 4 assist 9062 loss No 4 Florida State Saturday
Even loss Morant game leading scorer
Morants coach teammate firmest backer closest watcher acknowledge quite prepared It Morant received magic bean sold soul Devil crossroad
We didnt see jump he year coming Murray State assistant coach Casey Long said knew work ethic put ability allowed make jump
Jonathan Stark conference playeroftheyear honor last year Murray State team NBA development league roster said interview I knew going key ignition I knew going NBA player I knew going go first round
No 1 2 Stark added referring predicted draft position I honestly didnt know
A sudden rise like Morants supposed happen 2019 The best high school player spotted early gravitate top program treat basketball equivalent twohour airport layover way preferred even expected destination NBA
If expected Morant taken topthree pick first American freshman honored since 2013 first midmajor university since Memphiss Derrick Rose 2008
The college basketball establishment probably took longer catch Morants ability underrecruited Morant whose YouTube highlight reel hoop fanatic heavy rotation said Friday six foot tall recently senior year high school listed 6foot3 could reliably dunk ball nearly college
This also explains Morants coach Matt McMahon underrated freshman season one Morant averaged 127 point 63 assist 65 rebound per game number McMahon compared college season future NBA star like Anfernee Hardaway Jason Kidd
I think take leap I think receive enough credit terrific freshman year McMahon said
Morants evolution freshman sophomore season neither exponential linear Murray State strength conditioning coach Zach Whitman said Morant lanky listed 175 pound Whitman said probably added 20 pound since arriving Murray States campus far western Kentucky 2017
Over summer said teammate Brion Sanchious dunked one teammate I thought Yeah he
Morants shooting improved 2 3point percentage
But maybe explanation Morants remarkable improvement two season changing team dynamic around willingness last season sublimate number team sake
In senior Stark Terrell Miller Jr Racers two proven scorer last year They would go average nearly 37 point game combined lead Racers NCAA tournament Morant accepted role team third scoring option shared point guard duty experienced Stark
Last year I felt like I didnt take many shot Morant said
He role player last year due Jonathan Stark Terrell added Shaq Buchanan Morants current backcourt partner
He played role great Buchanan added time came leader player needed stepped delivered u
Morant prepared task summer hitting weight room court redoubled ferocity according teammate coach He also selected attend CP3 Elite Guard Camp crash course pointguarding connected NBAs Chris Paul
He came back CP3 Camp started pickup workout scoring high rate knew going able take jump aspect game said Long assistant coach
His teammate Devin Gilmore pointed earlyseason defeat Alabama evidence Morant assumed new role He scored 38 point taking nearly half team field goal
He know need done win assistant coach Tim Kaine said Last year two stud He knew guy He got ball put position going successful This year knew needed step scoring
One final thing helped Morant season might serve implicit rebuke college coach sought win game recruiting talented green freshman experience
Last year Murray State lost West Virginia 17 point NCAA tournament first round Morant 14 point 2 assist 3 rebound
This year put show tournament first day afterward Dwyane Wade tweeted Luka Doncic DeAaron Fox directmessaged Instagram And Morant hardly seemed fazed spoke locker room Friday afternoon
Last year I felt like I excited little bit nerve Morant said This year I feel way comfortable

His basketball legacy left many Seattle outraged day believing Mr Schultz either duplicitous duped others Yet action Starbucks including raft innovation introduced recession like health insurance baristas became stuff adoring Harvard Business School case study In Fortune magazine ranking Starbucks fifthmost admired company world
The common thread deeply familiar people city Mr Schultz called home since early 1980s echoed talk entering politics kind idealistic righteousness combined obvious conviction ability insight All worked like magic wand Seattle except didnt
Theres question built amazing business one Seattle benefited one worldwide reach said Greg Nickels Democrat second term Seattles mayor 2006

Mr Schultz 65 selfmade billionaire grew public housing Brooklyn said interview conducted request Starbucks decided whether seek White House set deadline A selfdescribed lifelong Democrat Mr Schultz said thought Democrats veering far left President Trump Republicans far right hunger centrist candidacy like one might put
But also said repeatedly recent speech around nation promoting new memoir would run became convinced candidacy could aid Mr Trumps reelection
Indeed announcement January seriously considering running brought outcry many Democrats feared split vote The president chimed tweeting Mr Schultz never sought public office doesnt gut Warren Buffett called Schultz candidacy mistake
As rule American politics independent fail get elected Since Civil War four minorparty candidate president mustered least 10 percent vote Ross Perot George Wallace Robert La Follette Theodore Roosevelt Roosevelt Republican turned Bull Moose candidate 1912 election couldnt win despite popular president year earlier But even getting le 10 percent make difference Ralph Nader showed 2000 election put George W Bush White House Electoral College victory even though Al Gore outgoing vice president popular vote
For part Mr Schultz belief independent president could powerful mandate governing refutation voter bitter divisive politics revenge paralyzed Washington The example could done would turn draw surge likeminded independent candidate would reshape Congress added
The current trajectory demonstrates evidence broken system Mr Schultz said Im looking situation realizing large majority Americans agree
If Mr Schultz run Seattle experience combined back story selfmade success would narrative tell sell Starbucks started different company Mr Schultz said culture defines Pacific Northwest The Sonics failed Seattle story Mr Schultz apologized In universe ventisize place success failure

Several people Legislature time said Mr Schultz never involved politics lobbying treated like outsider never appeared understand network informal alliance stood way Calls coming legislative office people connected city sport team saying didnt much like idea financing lot expensive new skybox seat
The Mariners Seahawks people terribly encouraging several back channel sort front channel stuff going said James McIntire Democratic state representative time later served two term state treasurer
Art Thiel longtime columnist sportswriter covered Sonics story said Mr Schultz simply didnt understand state capital He thought could pro sport owner sort thing could successful business owner either charm opposition bully said He got neither done
Barely five month hitting wall legislature Mr Schultz made good warning announcing coowners sold team group based Oklahoma moved renamed Thunder
Mr Schultz call decision one major regret life
My biggest mistake still reverberates Mr Schultz wrote recent oped piece The Seattle Times In book elaborates happened Almost everyone blamed initial denial I realized right I squandered public trust I bought
A longtime friend Mr Schultzs Howard Behar former vice president Starbucks said Mr Schultz learned experience warned advance straying world knew might dangerous
When bought company I quote local newspaper Seattle I said No good come I think he nut Mr Behar recalled And I right No good came

As scrolled spreadsheet saw Stuyvesant outlier The top specialized school even lower number black Hispanic student previous year These grimmest statistic black Hispanic enrollment school Id ever seen
It felt like watershed moment one would force people pay attention mostly local issue We scrambled get article posted online 430 pm moment data released public Within minute publication knew going article would resonate reader
By next day article one popular Times website nearly 1500 comment I simultaneously struck outraged many reader number unlikely exam would scrapped
I thought article would different next year admission day Would I spend another March afternoon writing dwindling number black Hispanic student specialized school Or first time year would article different

Its superpower letting black people
By Evan Narcisse
Mr Narcisse author Rise Black Panther graphic novel
Black Panther made 13 billion last year became one highestgrossing superhero movie time It delivering widescreen vision Black Excellence blackness isnt generational trauma pain come living racism Its reckoning choice made hold one culture best way carry future
Watching first time last year I felt overjoyed I tear I think scene TChalla fight become king Wakandans make way Warrior Falls elaborate floating procession expression communal love history culture I immersed Black Panther universe year comic fan critic creator Yet I still felt sitting premiere Los Angeles kind art I waited entire life
Superhero fiction tend toward aspirational showing humanity broadly idealized form thats exactly director Ryan Coogler team Black Panther Africa film presented place glorious achievement always happened Black Panther feel like celebration investigation mean part global African diaspora
After buzzing high I wondered next movie capable speaking deep level might Would another sweeping Black Excellence melodrama A slavery period piece fresh perspective A scifi legal drama black criminal defense attorney represent extraterrestrial refugee A thriller assassin target college basketball phenom organizing movement get friend paid
The answer turned something completely different Jordan Peeles new movie Us excites entirely different reason This stylish utterly terrifying horror film doesnt make black character superheroes doesnt They normal folk albeit one big creepy paranormal problem complete everydayness make film resonant
Us isnt institutionalized racism Its subject tension run fabric American life The family center film fighting life fight metaphor class tension periodically explode ugly factionalism United States
In film metaphorical economic stratification turn human being homicidal Others theyre called Tethers Us And rare turn black people film Wilson family arent Adelaide husband Gabe two child occupy position ordinary family life upended unsettling threat They dont respond martial prowess stoic durability either They freak hell like normal people would Like Griswolds National Lampoon movie Wilsons family vacation The parent grumble embrace kid bicker like sibling I went Disneyworld
When Wilsons inevitably come face face evil doppelgängers Us becomes film among thing unaddressed history creeping back life If Mr Peeles new film said moral might cost pay individual society wanting live good life mean burying past trauma refusing reckon
That director chooses rest prickly heart cinematic ambition darkskinned black woman Lupita Nyongo make even meaningful Her Adelaide Wilson isnt resolute military leader like Danai Guriras General Okoye Black Panther Shes nurturing nervous neurotic mother drawn nuance texture allows viewer relate matter walk life might come
My euphoria Black Panther last year felt like one answer deep yearning feel connected Africandescended people world see shared root reflected glory Us giddily fulfills different opposite need desire see black life reflected back lifesize scale idealized put pedestal Hey look there Winston Duke busting dad joke awkwardly explain favorite old song kid putting bass voice seem threatening actually really I thing lot friend
Ive spent lot time thinking come Wakanda Us point way broader horizon Hollywood explore Mr Peeles new film present black character way white one The specific texture blackness still palpable way talk react world around doesnt special meaning Its part could million black people world In Us black performer dont need symbol They even boogeypeople chasing onscreen For horror mystery Us element charming ordinariness give little bit hope movie coming postBlack Panther world

A middleaged woman dimple pinned number 22 back sweatshirt sent play catch The ball big flew easily hand partner glove It felt good throw familiar even We took turn hitting fielded grounder every base Each time I scooped ball hurled first Each time throw went straight woman mitt
The first month good Our team played week After game wed head bar wed drink beer rehash ump bad call Softball turning exactly I hoped would
And sometime June I started throwing wild
Im sure happened All I know I suddenly found incapable throwing ball
The loss skill complete I never able throw ball life Except I remembered clearly agonizing time throwing natural action body repertoire The motion deeply etched ligament seemed like process happened entirely outside brain

After particularly rough game coach pulled aside I desperate tell someone team happening I kind curse baseball skill apparently gone coma wasnt real I thought chance
You know Ive weird problem maybe anxiety This thing happens I cant throw ball
Her face went blank
Dont worry bud get nervous said Just best She patted shoulder headed
The realization came thud To coach I wasnt suffering kind performance anxiety I suckedSo I quit I didnt want damage relationship something source joy I stopped playing baseball I 11 I always carried something I good something one could take away Now seemed opposite true

Early first go father I hijacked ancient impulse Our family lived rowhouse neighborhood Philadelphia right street small playground gang boy gathered game stickball basketball My son loved playing sport But unprepared developed friend grew older
After year together laughing riding tricycle bike block several boy grew angry mean Ultimately turned son taunting leaving game He began trudge home tail leg And I felt called action
At first I tried bolster confidence would give playground another go But one Saturday morning I met front step told could come house You figure I said Ill stay long need I let give
He tried push past humiliation becoming frantic He melted screaming cry I kept saying You You dont give A neighbor poked head concerned must sounded like child abuse
Did I right thing Even Im sure He go back playground eventually managed kind truce kid He grew fine man teacher understands I trying help clumsy way But teaching stand I also passing along prejudice boy override pain never back fight
What happened son peer group perfectly predictable Boyhood immerses boy violence bullying lead High school boy likely girl physical fight past year male child likely victim violence Three type male violence violence woman violence men violence deeply interwoven
Violence spring boy learn mean man One researcher observed small group preschool boy noticed two year adapted cultural cue The way dressed played related one another parent changed significantly They even formed Mean Team harass girl classroom Another researcher interviewed elementaryschool boy captured brutally frank story punishing boy failed conform
Boys take experience heart feeling weak ashamed need comfort Plan International USA nonprofit group focused childrens right commissioned study among 10 19yearolds found nearly threequarters boy said felt pressure physically strong nearly half 14 19 yearold male respondent felt pressure willing punch someone provoked
The link masculine norm misconduct clearly established A 2017 study 18 30yearold men United States Britain Mexico found young men subscribe traditional gender identity unhappier prone bullying sexual harassment Nearly 60 percent American respondent said parent primary source restrictive cue
Boys dont come world inborn tendency toward domination violence As Stanford psychologist Albert Bandura explained People born preformed repertoire aggressive behavior They must learn The problem rooted boy socialization characterized physical discipline control disdain weakness
With template relating world surprising compared girl adolescent boy young men abuse tobacco higher rate drive recklessly engage riskier sex In United States 75 percent death among 15 24yearolds boy young men Males likely female die injury sustained car accident fall homicide Especially risk masculinity compounded racism poverty many boy survive manhood
When I young I went urban allboys high school bigger violent guy ruled One spring school dance electric charge fight surged crowd rushed one gym exit I could make guy lunch table One older boy others said crazy hauling kicking another boy died night head trauma
I never forgotten scene As psychologist I spoken many young men similarly harrowing experience I heard many parent effect son In grip stressful experience like boy often pull away family They become accountable love brotherhood seek impress
The parent understandably feel anxious Their son behave certain way lackadaisical school unkind toward sibling anxious angry shy parent intervene concern irritation hand heavy They try give advice become even frustrated alarmed son hear
Fathers especially may feel time changed much since boy counsel amount outdated clichés And true generation boy much better position ass future But true needed far
What parent must son never underestimate power listening knowing standing navigate rough water boyhood Behind every boy avoids swept away current someone hold belief ability hold

Its vasectomy season United States But American woman get sterilized higher rate
By Christina Caron
A newsletter parent evidencebased guidance personal story transformed life kid Sign get NYT Parenting inbox every week
March Madness upon u urologist throughout country mean one thing Its vasectomy season
Let explain
Every year men schedule vasectomy conjunction NCAA men basketball tournament watch game recovering couch frozen bag pea
In fact Mayo Clinic Rochester Minn many men sign vasectomy March Madness appointment reach max capacity said Dr Tobias S Kohler urologist men health expert medical center observed phenomenon ever since attending physician decade ago
But even though study last year found peak number vasectomy March also end year holiday men country dont opt sterilization They rely female partner prevent pregnancy
In United States female sterilization twice prevalent vasectomy according 2015 estimate United Nations despite fact vasectomy equally effective le invasive carry lower risk complication
Why Its blend cost misconception fear procedure cultural expectation truly defines man
Chris Lopez 34 father three boy Suffolk Va said even though wife planning child he idea vasectomy
If I couldnt produce kid medical reason biological reason I know fact would make feel good said
For Mr Lopez ability rear child tied belief masculinity A man many thing said strong brave good dancer also he supposed able kid thats want
Then practical consideration added Looking ahead 20 year wife still married Will even alive
Maybe I meet younger woman something like want kid I cant give Mr Lopez said
His wife Sarah KennedyLopez 38 said laughed husband first discussed hypothetical scenario even understands he coming
Not couple make said adding life go spouse die
Their child 7yearold 4yearold twin conceived via vitro fertilization chance getting pregnant without assistance low neither us birth control So isnt pressing issue
A couple time I said Well know could get vasectomy take care would worry say No Im You go get tube tied said But I wouldnt want either especially I feel like I went enough conceiving child first place
Studies shown men receive vasectomy United States typically white nonHispanic live North Central Western region country They also tend private insurance
Vasectomy covered either partially full insurance plan procedure may require referral primary care provider Without insurance price usually 1000 Vasectomy reversal however covered insurance procedure cumbersome expensive
By contrast Affordable Care Act required insurance company cover 18 type contraception used woman including sterilization surgery copayment required
Aside cost getting vasectomy often requires multiple visit doctor first establish consent surgery later figure sperm purged ejaculate The entire process take three month
Dr Anuj Khattar fellow Physicians Reproductive Health practice Seattle area estimated initial consultation 20 30 percent patient end either changing mind simply showing procedure
I think part fear around vasectomy permanent Dr Khattar said adding men worry losing virility ability enjoy sex
But physiologically doesnt affect function said Theres lot misinformation
Ryan Cragun professor sociology University Tampa father one said despite desire get vasectomy lastminute doubt Oh gosh Im basically sterilizing recalled thinking
Even though estimated half million men receive vasectomy United States year Dr Cragun said isnt something men tend talk openly
Postvasectomy report sex life improved especially wife longer taking birth control
Her libido there condom involved better Thats winwin every regard said
In country including Britain South Korea Canada Ireland Spain Australia prevalence vasectomy exceeds female sterilization according United Nations But worldwide like United States female sterilization far common couple use contraception choose method designed used woman
Caila Smith 25 mother Huntington Ind said encouraged get tube tied health care provider became pregnant twin second time
She didnt like side effect birth control pill DepoProvera injection tried past opted tubal ligation child born part covered full insurance told could get procedure done cesarean section
After enduring painful recovery learned fiancé could gotten vasectomy minimal cost higher risk ectopic pregnancy something wasnt clear beforehand
They gave form I guess I kind skimmed know without digging deep could happen said If I knew I knew I feel like I would pushed get vasectomy
Unlike vasectomy quick outpatient procedure cut seal tube carry sperm block transfer sperm ejaculate tubal ligation far invasive often conducted general anesthesia The surgery involves cutting blocking fallopian tube carry higher rate complication including damage surrounding organ said Dr Holly Bullock assistant professor department obstetrics gynecology University Arizona College Medicine Tucson
The procedure benefit however
It immediately effective completely decision rely upon partner followthrough get procedure followup postvasectomy semen analysis prove effective Dr Bullock said
Tubal ligation may even reduce risk ovarian cancer particularly among woman BRCA1 BRCA2 gene mutation according American Cancer Society And removing fallopian tube entirely procedure called salpingectomy thought reduce risk even Dr Bullock said Thats doctor believe ovarian cancer originate cell tube
But added recommends vasectomy patient exploring permanent option
Marco Cabrera 38 father two Traverse City Mich vasectomy 2016 said I feel like one place men need quoteunquote man adding knew men refused get vasectomy insisting wife undergo sterilization instead
Im really unimpressed men I meet said
Despite complication surgery I still think vasectomy worth said I dont worry anymore I know Ive done part

I think fair question ask Did really understand know could predicted issue would said Robert L Kirkpatrick Jr time dean admission Wesleyan University Middletown Conn part early effort The answer I think instinctively trying right thing
Columbia Ivy League campus right next Harlem particularly revelatory setting Perhaps nowhere else division striking privilege inside university gate trouble demand black people outside
The New York Times tracked many nearly 50 black student Columbias Class 1973 arrived campus freshman 1969 Some remained close friend helped locate others directory photograph
The number black student admitted Columbia doubled 1969 year About half enrolled received degree four year later

One Lee Bollinger current president Columbia first arrived campus law student 1968
In time sense pure simple university part help integrate higher education Mr Bollinger said We still mission sense purpose urgency connection past dissipated
Mr Goodson sits plastic milk crate covered clean brightly colored cushion He wrapped layer flannel shirt sweatshirt canvas jacket wear stylish suede shoe A watch cap graying goatee hide face
He resents people assume homeless plop bag food next without even asking He forgiving police officer routinely ask would like go shelter He joke No thanks place Trump Tower across street His apartment short subway ride away far jazz club play weekly gig
Mr Goodson grew housing project Fort Greene Brooklyn day known Ervin His mother housekeeper wealthy family Park Avenue father tailor owned drycleaning shop time He took early liking music learning play viola Cora Roth fifthgrade teacher Public School 46 Brooklyn painter Los Angeles still remembers pure soul

When racially fueled teacher strike broke Mr Goodsons senior year parent managed transfer Wooster School another boarding school Connecticut He middling student Stuyvesant vaulted top class private school
An English teacher drove Columbia admission interview remembers feeling little bit phony answered question He also accepted Dartmouth chose Columbia closer home
In college Mr Goodson realized could reinvent began going Les middle name instead Ervin He wanted photographer took picture BB King Amiri Baraka band Sha Na Na Miranda camera He made rash decision spending 600 1500 student loan Karmann Ghia sport car
Not much course catalog spoke

Nothing stopped finishing Mr Goodson said I something else
While civil right leader pressed college admit black student big push came assassination Dr King April 4 1968 followed uprising 100 city student strike
I dont see understand apart upheaval campus racial upheaval larger society general upheaval around world said Jerome Karabel professor sociology University California Berkeley historian college admission
Later month student occupied several building protest saw Columbias complicity Vietnam War plan build gym Harlem park The standoff ended violent clash police
The radical politics 1968 came late affect admission decision fall acceptance notice already gone But 1969 number black student recruited admitted Ivy League university sister school rose sharply year many case 100 percent according statistic published The Times April 1969
From 1968 1969 according archival data provided Columbia year number student recorded black applied rose 220 121 number admitted rose 130 58 number registered rose 48 31 total class 700 All men Columbia College begin admitting woman 1980s
Some black student class resisted cast emissary racial understanding
Gregory Peterson classmate Mr Goodson seen going University Club see racial framework I shied away anything like black group said I didnt grow way
He twin brother Maurice advanced class predominantly white school although part black middle class East Elmhurst Queens Their father owned barbershop mother teacher
When Mr Peterson high school mother white friend took cocktail party met white intellectual gone Exeter Harvard He became mentor encouraging Mr Petersons ambition apply Ivy League university
At Columbia Mr Peterson English major mixed white student He discovered gay identity though remained closeted
He experience racial discrimination college A Southern white Barnard student apologized able invite party back home An older man reception assumed basketball team
But race took back seat sexuality I busy problem gay I didnt notice black said
After graduating 1973 Mr Peterson spent year art rational side took went Columbia Law School He went become corporate lawyer His brother also graduated Columbia owns spa
Mr Peterson husband live high floor prewar building 72nd Street Riverside Drive prime Manhattan location The lightfilled apartment crammed art collection A portrait Paul Hodgson Mr Peterson formal suit looking cerebral commanding hang one wall
A back Mr Peterson got cab way University Club greeted street musician
Hey Gregory Lester Columbia musician said
The sound saxophone often filtered club gymnasium steam vent Mr Peterson never known playing He stopped recognized classmate
I tell I totally flipped Mr Peterson said
He know enough Mr Goodsons life judge said But encounter made conscious good fortune
In July 1972 Eldridge McKinney black sophomore Columbia shot dean student several time 38caliber handgun Mr McKinney suspended bad grade angry reinstated police said By one news account shouted racist bastard dean white opening fire
The dean Henry S Coleman badly wounded returned work Mr Coleman caught campus turmoil student occupied Hamilton Hall took hostage 1968
Mr McKinneys fall grace steep He arrived Columbia fall 1970 year behind Mr Goodson Mr Peterson overachiever Boy Scout leader valedictorian high school South Side Chicago member band school newspaper yearbook math chess Spanish club according The Chicago Tribune time But Columbia something changed
After shooting Mr McKinneys mother Roy Innis civil right leader publicly pleaded turn Charged attempted murder disappeared Classmates remember jarring sight face wanted poster post office His friend believe living assumed name identity nearly 47 year
Mr McKinney nicknamed E became something legend Some black student quietly cheered understanding rage E sort like semihero time apparently got away Mr Goodson said And every Ill ask somebody Yo man ever hear E

Black Hispanic alumnus day recall forming tight bond They studied together They went party listened different music Mr Downing recalled black friend preferred rhythm blue white classmate listened Jimi Hendrix
We massive massive study group everybody would pile black lounge Mr Downing said Many black student felt pulled two direction assimilation resistance
I think thats still open question people mind Are expected stay ghetto identity world adapt said Julius Gonzalez son Cuban factory worker West Harlem member Class 1973 Or make adjustment adapt outside world
Despite hard could adapt many success story among black student Class 1973
Mr Gonzalez whose factoryworker parent gradeschool education got MBA Harvard became financial officer energy venture abroad He retired living Florida
Gary Friday son beer distributor Philadelphia became neurologist Eric Coleman whose widowed mother straightened curled hair kitchen took laundry state judge Connecticut

The common perception professor made allowance minority student false Mr Gonzalez said If anything black invited tougher scrutiny Some guy smirked looked said What You misspelled term said You prove wrong
Within year university stopped taking many gamble The early press coverage celebratory Colleges That Recruit Ghetto Find Effort Benefits All Concerned read headline The Wall Street Journal 1968 But soon became skeptical
Thomas Sowell black professor economics University California Los Angeles wrote The Times 1970 white college administrator misguided romanticism admitting unqualified authentic ghetto type setting fail overlooking intellectually oriented black student

Since Supreme Court consistently upheld right college use race one factor admission Now Harvard fighting claim manipulating admission process exclude AsianAmericans

On May 10 2017 le 24 hour President Trump fired James Comey FBI director Comey received email man never met The correspondent Matt Latimer began praising Comeys decade faithful service United States government cause law order offering sympathy tumultuous period going Then Latimer got heart matter As head Washington literary agency called Javelin wanted Comey know ever interest writing book wed urge consider possibility wanted Comey client
Javelin prepared invest story Latimer wrote Its least someone given much country
Comey want write book He sent Latimer polite response saying much But several month later began warm idea thought back correspondence Latimer There something tone email Comey recently told I liked tone
Latimer Keith Urbahn Latimers partner Javelin went lunch Comey golf club Their pitch We partner way thats unusual literaryagency business Comey recalled Before literary agent Latimer Urbahn Republican operative viewed book project akin political campaign They told Comey would work proposal shop publisher would also help writing social medium presence publicity called messaging whole project They promised offer brutal feedback time One big challenge place especially Washington getting people tell unvarnished truth especially stink Comey said I knew I could count guy tell I sucked
Comey come around idea writing book wanted said useful wake something bad happening make something good come He envisioned memoir leadership book reflecting lesson learned course long career What want write anything 109 tumultuous day Trumps FBI director I desperate Trump book writer told
Latimer Urbahn gave brutal feedback late We convinced come book doesnt deal thing people want know hell happened room one one Trump youre going leaving major question unanswered people unsatisfied Urbahn said And youre going asked anyway They sold Comey idea storydriven book career including experience Trump word memoir essentially tricked people learning leadership lesson hoped convey Their logic strong Comey said
Comey insisted writing book forgoing ghostwriter leaned heavily Latimer Urbahn editorial assistance The draft sent would come back slashed Comey recalled They vision I didnt They also possessed understanding political medium landscape Comey even publisher lacked We knew minute book came going people criticizing didnt go far enough Latimer said He didnt say Trump Russian agent Theres news Blah blah blah So wanted set book term early
Last March month book publication date Latimer Urbahn Comey tweet Trump Mr President American people hear story soon They hosted gettoknowyou meeting Comey news anchor vying first interview negotiated network primetime slot They briefed reporter background book newsiest bit
When finally arrived bookstore A Higher Loyalty Truth Lies Leadership indeed tell lesson ethical leadership Comey learned rolling Gambino crime family prosecuting Martha Stewart But book final 90 page received attention Comey offered dramatic blowbyblow account FBI investigation Russias effort help Trump 2016 campaign hairraising interaction Trump election Before even reached publication day Urbahn said sold half million copy
One morning February I went see Latimer Urbahn office sits second floor 19thcentury rowhouse Washington suburb Alexandria Va A steady snowfall obscured usual view Potomac River office window Latimer 48 Urbahn 35 dressed weather khaki duck boot like couple prepschool English teacher Their work space feel cozy reading room lot exposed brick shelf crammed book along occasional bottle bourbon Posters client book jacket decorate wall Most typical Washington fare campaign biography Ted Cruz book Nancy Reagan former press secretary reportage essay political journalist pundit
Since A Higher Loyalty published townhouse become popular destination Trump administration official especially contemplating exit way Urbahn told Theyre planning get Latimer chimed Weve met talked probably every major official would know departed thinking departing Trump White House said
Read secretary state Mike Pompeo one last remaining memebers Trumps original White House team
The problem official many White House exit nailed shut The path executive branch highly remunerative privatesector work standard postadministration trajectory better worse recent decade used smooth Barack Obamas press secretary Jay Carney Amazon George W Bushs communication director Dan Bartlett Walmart attest While veteran Trumps State Treasury Departments tended navigate path successfully enough people worked controversial precinct Trump World hard time even getting job interview If publicly traded company CEO doesnt worry blowback shareholder hire someone administration one former senior Trump administration official requested anonymity discus travail friend colleague told They concerned employee going react If company office Silicon Valley New York Los Angeles DC hard play
Latimer Urbahn turned professional abyss market niche Their central insight hoary old fixture Washington selfpromotion tellall may ideal solution new problem postTrump rehabilitation A juicy memoir stand earn former Trump official small fortune thanks unprecedented interest administration intrigue It also give official opportunity reposition redeem A lot trying figure How I make something wellbeing Latimer told But also How I distance guy
After two helped Comey land book advance shy 3 million 2017 Urbahn said people whose entire job basically undermine Comey came u asking u think next step Last year Latimer secured former White House aide Cliff Sims sevenfigure deal book Trump experience Team Vipers published January Now rarely week go Latimer Urbahn dont hear someone administration
As result Latimer Urbahn ceased agent theyve become career counselor life coach The challenge Trump people theyre looking legitimacy theyre looking sort outlet unburden baggage come job Urbahn said Some honest others
They dream Trump author Latimers anonymous senior Trump official wrote OpEd The New York Times last September effort thwart president within administration Urbahns Robert Mueller But Trump figure would dismiss hand I asked would interested representing Rudy Giuliani We pretty much mind probably would meet almost anyone least see Latimer said The question Urbahn added If there money made going feel good helping someone redemption tour
Granted conscience always salved One person came u would know said If I turned Trump book much money could I get Is worth Latimer recalled And like Its hard know tell u everything want say The potential client hesitated many card willing reveal
So Latimer said still talking person
In 1985 Michael Kinsley editor The New Republic colleague visit several Washington bookstore place note deep inside copy three important supposedly well read political book year offering 5 reward anyone found one note No one ever claimed money
The stunt illustrated fundamental truth Washington book While may sell theyre rarely read And would Washington book tend dull design safe campaign memoir senator governor bloodlessly telling rise prepares embark White House run legacyburnishing memoir retired cabinet official recounting equally bloodless tale challenge met competitor bested obstacle overcome
But Washington tellall often exception rule The modern trend book date 1986 David Stockman Ronald Reagans first budget director wrote The Triumph Politics devastating account Reagan White House fundamentally unwilling unable tame government spending Reagan promised ran president Stockman sort administration official previously would le anonymous public But proximity power important willing dish
Stockman professed civic responsibility grown concerned said fiscal consequence Reagan administration supplyside economics But lucrative form responsibility He received 24 million advance book went best seller became foundational text Reagan critic
Some way leave Trump White House
Stockmans deal brokered Robert Barnett lawyer Washington law firm Williams Connolly Barnett former top aide Walter Mondale mostly whitecollar defense work Stockmans book led impressive side hustle He would later handle book deal Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton George W Bush Barack Obama Michelle Obama among others invariably came described press superlawyer Barnett bill client hour rather taking publishing industry standard 15 percent commission bridle called agent
Barnett continued represent political player like Stockman lesser sufficient Washington wattage including former Clinton communication director George Stephanopoulos Bush adviser Karl Rove Obama strategist David Axelrod He also represented Bushs first defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld selling 2011 memoir Known Unknown
But Rumsfeld came back Barnett idea book leadership lesson Rumsfelds Rules Barnett unenthusiastic prospect This rankled Rumsfelds ghostwriter Latimer Urbahn met year earlier speechwriter Rumsfelds office Pentagon Latimer already knew something publishing industry written funny incisive political memoir Speechless time speechwriter Rumsfeld later George W Bush He Urbahn took Rumsfeld first client Rumsfeld got 1 million advance HarperCollins Latimer Urbahn founded Javelin naming agency handle Secret Service given Rumsfelds wife They set sight displacing Barnett king Washington literary hill
For year Barnett looked nose Latimer Urbahn claiming client often people already rejected But Comeys decision sign Javelin suggested Trumps election disrupted Washington literary scene along everything else In initial email Comey pitching Javelins service Latimer wrote We confident beat advance youd receive working agent socalled superlawyer
Barnett isnt exactly hurting business last year No1 Michelle Obama No5 Bob Woodward nonfiction best seller representing former Trump administration official Gary Cohn Nikki Haley forthcoming book But Trump era spelled end nearmonopoly brokering political blockbuster Bob Barnett establishment establishment went one book editor specializes political title worked Barnett Javelin told But look bestseller list day establishment anymore In new paradigm dont need former chief economic adviser former United Nations ambassador former FBI director matter get sevenfigure advance tellall
You could instance Cliff Sims As typical Trump era Simss path prominence random circuitous A former junior college basketball player Christianrockband frontman wandered politics running conservative website became megaphone Mike Hubbard rapacious corrupt speaker House Representatives Simss home state Alabama This turn led Trump campaign led White House worked January 2017 May 2018 communication aide
Sims admirer Trump remains sympathetic though fashion cleareyed president But butted head number White House colleague including John Kelly chief staff ultimately blocked advancement In one memorable dustup Kelly Sims argued whether Sims permission get Trump sign football already autographed University Alabamas national championship team Sims hoped give Alabamas governor When Sims decided wanted write book chose Latimer Urbahn agent part told working White House saw firsthand whoever press comms Comey book good
We coffee Washingtons fancy new Wharf development near Sims recently moved apartment wife After week saturationlevel appearance cable news book rollout attained Beltwayspecific form celebrity Strangers approached Acela selfies He getting ready hit road number corporate speaking gig experience Trump Some people want entertaining story like work Sims said Others wanted substantive talk negotiates approach interaction foreign country help give window think people around
Sims initially hoped write selfhelp book entrepreneur along line The 21 Irrefutable Laws Leadership pastor motivational speaker John Maxwell But Latimer Urbahn prodded toward memoir They encouraged write would write werent afraid Sims said They encouraged honest And I think thats book kind stood marketplace The Spicer book I guess example book people didnt find credible
Sims referring Sean Spicer Simss old White House bos cautionary tale Early short tenure Trumps press secretary Spicer contacted Latimer Urbahn knew Spicer day Republican National Committee spokesman help plotting escape Matts advice Look youve got leave term Urbahn said If think time go havent pulled cord yet late
The agent laid careful exit strategy Spicer began resignation medium blackout eventually memoir overly critical Trump acknowledged president Spicers shortcoming finally new career pundit Karl Rove model Urbahn explained When Spicer announced resignation July 21 2017 Latimer Urbahn assumed plan motion
Then saw news Twitter Spicer would appearing Sean Hannitys Fox News show night Urbahn called Spicer immediately I said I saw youre going go Hannity tonight Youre literally going cost seven figure Youre going telegraph world everything copacetic Trump youre going biggest fan outside Its want told u game plan go contributor television
Spicer went Hannity anyway Latimer Urbahn eventually gave He hired Barnett get TV contract superlawyer couldnt deliver Using different agent Spicer wound getting publishing deal Trump memoir The Briefing one would mistaken tellall sell well Last month became special correspondent entertainment news show Extra In debut quizzed Secretary State Mike Pompeo music listens
Things went similarly sideways Omarosa Manigault Newman erstwhile Apprentice star former White House aide In early 2018 Latimer Urbahn negotiated substantial contract Hachette book would offer extremely critical take Trump But several week agreement hand Manigault Newman without informing Hachette appeared CBS reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother offered disparaging remark Trump thereby undercutting surprise book Hachette backed deal
Represented different agent Manigault Newman later signed book deal Simon Schuster CBS subsidiary After Sims signed book deal Manigault Newman sent brief congratulatory text Juicy She Spicer failed understand Latimer told key getting Trump World view mystery
Of course make successful tellall book mystery also revelation contains alarming better The specter ballooning deficit counted alarming Stockmans day seems quaint compared Comeys fear Trump colluded foreign adversary obstructed justice Indeed stake attached charge made Trump tellalls high fair ask charge delivered book In past insider perceived secret sort stake whether straightarrow administration official like John Dean canny bureaucratic operator like Mark Felt rogue whistleblower like Daniel Ellsberg Edward Snowden couch least first bid bestseller list Would dire warning Comey successor Andrew McCabe whose book The Threat How FBI Protects America Age Terror Trump published February carry weight author werent receiving million
Thats reasonable question Comey conceded In case I would suggest I offered free public testimony June 8 2017 That Comey appeared Senate Intelligence Committee revealed among thing Trump directed stop investigating former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn That essence story Comey continued rest Im trying offer broader well beyond Trump lesson leader
I posed question Urbahn Books still cultural weight people treat differently opeds congressional testimony said This part American experience people since Grant Ulysses S Grant course wrote memoir dying throat cancer desperate losing money Ponzi scheme leave inheritance wife child In process produced one great autobiography American letter one still read century later Will said Trump author
Guy Snodgrass would like think One Latimer Urbahns newest client Snodgrass somewhat atypical Trump administration refugee He Navy pilot nearly two decade one time commanding FA18 squadron Japan went work communication director Defense Secretary James Mattis April 2017 Last August left Pentagon retired Navy long reached Latimer Urbahn
Snodgrass told wanted meet two agent interested writing book time Pentagon Mattis order highlight professionalism Defense Department colleague give future military officer understanding really like work level He envisioned book might one day taught Naval Academy alma mater
Latimer Urbahn told interested meeting Snodgrass wanted hear inside dope might able share He story like inside inner circle crazy frenetic pace traveling around world hardcharging secretary defense Urbahn recalled There also number interaction Donald Trump uh Urbahn paused began chuckle interesting They agreed take Snodgrass client helped write proposal December got sixfigure book deal Penguin imprint The book scheduled published fall
On recent morning Snodgrass sitting Javelins conference room He finished first draft ready Latimer Urbahn give note Wearing windbreaker bore insignia Navys elite Top Gun pilot school served instructor Snodgrass templed finger listened agent critique
They told needed make chapter le chronological thematic They pressed draw fuller portrait Mattis go greater detail seen experienced especially came Mattiss interaction Trump
It memoir reminded policy book I think entire value proposition book talked beginning Urbahn explained here sort cornfed allAmerican guy who going tell like inside room Trump Mattis
Snodgrass seemed bit uncomfortable He worried going detail revealing everything proximity power enabled witness old Navy colleague might accuse selling Im coming slightly different angle Snodgrass told agent My entire adult life serving uniform always service self dont selfaggrandize
A central argument Snodgrasss book Mattis first year Pentagon able tame Trumps damaging instinct convincing president policy Mattis military brass preferred area like NATO Afghanistan fact one Trump wanted Now Latimer Urbahn trying perform similar move Snodgrass
The way inoculate charge selfaggrandizement really good argument youre book Latimer told Snodgrass And purpose said opportunity observe significant thing happened history turbulent time unprecedented time Pentagon there lesson warning want offer people danger ahead risk ahead That make important people know saw
Snodgrass nodded agreement Their logic strong
Three potential book cover publisher designed displayed TV screen Latimer Urbahn Snodgrass agreed title Holding Line perfect none liked subtitle Inside Pentagon With General Mattis Its got something Trump Latimer said commercial purpose
The cover Latimer Urbahn liked featured photograph Mattis sitting next Trump cabinet meeting Trump somewhat blurry foreground speaking Mattis sharp focus regarded president mute stoicism That photo entire book Latimer exclaimed It really It agent could already envision angry presidential tweet cover might provoke book sale tweet would drive
A picture worth thousand word Latimer told Snodgrass In case hundred thousand word

Read preview NCAA Womens Final Four
Ogunbowale ready Now senior made buzzerbeaters counted Specifically last year sequence without precedent Ogunbowale hit lastsecond shot give team victory semifinal championship game
The stunning nature Ogunbowales feat catapulted kind mainstream fame rarely bestowed woman college basketball despite improved play introduction top program struggled broaden appeal
Ogunbowale appeared The Ellen DeGeneres Show Kobe Bryant greeted surprise guest She participated television competition Dancing With The Stars She ESPY Award play year
Shout woman basketball whole said acceptance speech Theres lot people opinion u I got say come see u court
It telling moment Even triumph winning worthy nominee mostly men sport Ogunbowale chose promote game
Theres still long way go advocate Ogunbowale said interview last month
I think Final Four superexciting added noting semifinal also gone overtime got people thinking like OK yeah actually fun watch
The Final Four response illustrated intertwined discussion woman basketball meta discussion woman basketball popularity
If Arike men side take roll said Courtney Cox doctoral candidate University Southern California study woman basketball But instead pressure come back
If win twice weekend Notre Dame would fourth woman basketball team repeat national champion And Ogunbowale play starring role seems good candidate become rare woman basketball star kind firstname status enjoyed star athlete like Michael Kobe LeBron Serena
This notion growing game phrase hear lot WNBA college game Cox said But I think game flourishing Part acknowledging disparity thats already existed fact woman tournament existed NCAA level since 1982
The college basketball establishment changed several visible aspect woman game effort increase exposure For instance Ogunbowales shot might made larger splash came Friday Sunday night men semifinal title game rather SundayTuesday time slot woman Final Four previously occupied
That one several recommendation made paper Val Ackerman first WNBA president wrote NCAA 2013 amid fear declining attendance stagnant rating topheavy woman tournament Others included experimental rule change 24second shot clock toying slightly lower rim considering making woman basketball onesemester sport even hosting men woman Final Fours city establishing multiyear site woman event much Omaha always host College World Series
The visibility level bit lower men said Ackerman Big East commissioner Its one broader challenge
Of Ogunbowale Ackerman added The aftermath championship proved happen compelling performance national stage
There one kind compelling though One season interesting moment also involved Ogunbowale occurred Connecticut visited Notre Dame nonconference game December During game Huskies easily Ogunbowale received technical foul appeared word Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma latest spat two subtweeted one another Ogunbowale dropped UConn list program recruiting
Neither Ogunbowale Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw would address technical directly interview But argument good game resembled drama drive NBA news cycle made like ESPN writer DArcy Maine said Im pettiness
Much NBA ridden personality star greater popularity woman basketball growth require sport league always needed talented charismatic star
The get casual fan go Oh Notre Dames playing Im going turn see Arike said McGraw interest fan well get
Coincidentally broadcast Notre Dame regularseason game ESPN network 12 percent last year according network spokeswoman
Its yet said Gregory Ogunbowale Arikes father Arike others trying put map OK equally good As father woman I respect Its dunking fundamental skill
He noticed one difference however One Arikes older brother Dare running back played Wisconsin NFL team In past Gregory said teacher Milwaukee elementary school principal would ask Dare others would mention daughter athlete Now said reverse
One colleague couple week ago passed office said Hi Arikes Dad said I never heard

The win Izzos second Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski career He 211 versus fellow Hall Famer
After surviving last two game combined 3 point Dukes road ended Capital One Arena place given Washington Wizards poor record one Dukes likely freshman lottery pick could well play home game next year
Maybe RJ Barrett finished 21 point 6 assist 6 rebound going 3for6 deep Or perhaps future Washingtonian Cam Reddish missed Virginia Tech game knee tendinitis looked spry contributing 8 point 4 rebound 37 minute
Of course Washington end top pick Wizard Williamson even defeat proved best player court leading player 24 point 19 shot along 14 rebound 3 block 3 steal
Barrett Williamson appeared dazed postgame news conference Duke two loss season aside six game Williamson missed sprained knee sneaker blew opening second game versus North Carolina

It hasnt turned way
Since American Football League merged NFL 1970 World Football League United States Football League future XFL United Football League others While varying business model franchise location opinion best calendar football none league yet found right formula sustained success
Now seems Alliance American Football soon follow grave
The league chief executive cofounder Charlie Ebersol probably known better He son Dick Ebersol longtime NBC Sports chairman started first iteration XFL nearly 20 year ago alongside professional wrestling impresario Vince McMahon That league folded single season
With help Polian former general manager Indianapolis Colts Ebersol secured distribution deal league game CBS TNT NFL Network strong sign new league The deal included little cash however according two people
I think blind spot people want start professional sport league said Michael Huyghue commissioner United Football League The biggest issue What revenue stream What revenue model The UFL began play 2009 ceased operation 2012
Most league require substantial television right payment survive well critical mass ticket sale Both difficult obtain unproven league Knowing substantial startup cost would Alliance tried justify operation comparing Silicon Valley tech company expects lose money year creating value Ebersol believed league technology readiness legalized gambling would make success
From beginning Ebersol modest expectation Year One
There going empty seat quite time committed longterm investment around idea said interview February shortly season began
He estimated Alliance would require 500 million 750 million first five year
You justify expense either eccentric billionaire creating football league raising really smart money patient Ebersol said
The Alliances eight team clustered Southeast Southwest began play Super Bowl They played eight regular season game championship game scheduled April 27 Frisco Tex
But almost beginning sign thing werent going well including report league almost missed payroll
Last week league controlling owner Tom Dundon told USA Today league danger folding hadnt secured agreement NFL NFL Players Association allow young player NFL roster work Alliance
If player union going give u young player cant development league said Dundon also owner NHLs Carolina Hurricanes Just two week Alliances game schedule committed 250 million became controlling owner
But Huyghue whose United Football League lasted almost four season wrong focus
Everyone keep thinking player player player said That doesnt solve revenue problem
Polians statement blamed Dundon decision suspend league When Mr Dundon took belief cofounder Charlie Ebersol would finish season pay creditor make necessary adjustment move forward manner made economic sense Polian said
Dundon could reached comment
Despite poor track record Alliance surely wont last attempt start new professional football league McMahon reviving XFL begin play next year last week sold almost 272 million World Wrestling Entertainment stock support venture according company filing The Pacific Pro League founded Don Yee Tom Bradys agent also set start playing next year
The AAFs decision shut immediate repercussion least one Alliances partner Saturday afternoon game Memphis San Antonio scheduled shown CBS serving leadin two men Final Four college basketball game

Purging possession anatomy revealed I treasured
By Robin Troy
After Christmas last year boyfriend child exwife I went vacation daughter sunny spot far separate home Montana We together year sometimes blending childrens life sometimes feeling need I dont think define arrangement marriage
On trip stayed spare beach cottage I stared day sea four white bowl generously spaced along wooden shelf kitchen sink In wake another bloated Christmas simplicity bowl stood stark contrast clutter I left back home
By end vacation bowl never used part real life course burned hole brain within six hour return I thrown dozen garbage bag stuff I getting started I guided image four bowl also line old friend used say whenever I asked needed another beer Need funny word
Every day I threw stuff taking break walk dog I started laughing I acting ridiculous chucking anything didnt need I suddenly obsessed decluttering I scheduled surgery following week I scared As single parent simply could die I whatever I could distract risk lay ahead
No matter odds dying surgery minuscule I hysterectomy It another way unceremoniously throw away object I longer needed My mother done 40 I 44 child
She died 68 I 38 radiation damage cancer treatment decade earlier I wished I could talk mostly I trying keep busy I bad joke How could I seen I
As turned surgery breeze I back regular life time The next week walking dog trail near condo I pulled ball chase When I threw neighboring field filled nearly two foot snow ring I wear sailed finger vanished
I gasped My mother given ring time I taken surgery prior week I couldnt lose
I afraid move lest I disturb snow thinking surface indentation matter tiny might reveal ring landing spot I called boyfriend I called friend watching girl The three u collectively called halfdozen store tracked used metal detector pawnshop
My friend drove girl pick It 2 pm hour daylight left While I waited friend arrive metal detector pack parent child dog arrived crosscountry ski equipment Though I dazed remember I must told I lost ring I heard wondering aloud wedding ring
I didnt answer
An older woman another dog showed joined skiing crowd She talking loudly asking going I protecting snow dog wishing would leave silence mourn There way I would find
When skier left woman came said Is wedding ring
No I said sharply
A minute later man ran making eye contact way made think might know small town I didnt recognize He stopped running asked I right You look distraught said
I lost ring
Your wedding ring
No Im married I didnt mask exasperation
Id flustered He kind I sad He left I stared snow No ring No mother No husband Not even uterus How easy would dissolve pity party But reality I jazzed surgery In reality I love life family boyfriend
Why weddingring assumption keep setting On vacation nearly everyone met called boyfriend husband Talking another couple beach referred one child daughter Do need married I dont know Mostly boyfriend like say I want nothing
But I needed ring
The metal detector pawnshop juryrigged piece junk duct tape holding battery place item I would hauled dump day earlier My friend turned nothing happened
I getting frantic cold I left girl friend guard snow I drove buy new battery time another halfhour daylight wasted metal detector beeped life The metaldetecting needle didnt budge tested machine dropping penny snow beeped The sun lower I drained heartbeat
It seemed impossible cheap hunk plastic hand might produce miracle I took slow step field sweeping snow A crowd gathered The skier back My friend teenage son buddy arrived The kind runner actually run home showered driven back check unable shake upset I appeared
It didnt even take long 15 minute detector beeped I remained skeptical I figured picking metal zipper boot But faint beep persisted one spot I knelt poked finger snow ring
I burst tear I turned show crowd mostly stranger It felt little weird consider telling ring story invested time
My mom gave ring I 20 I said She diagnosed cancer 25 told year live She hadnt even gone first date dad When got engaged doctor told might five year They went anyway got married On 50th birthday threw big party refused present She gave ring day three band gold engraved name name dad She died 18 year later Ive never taken
Now handful stranger cry
I spared surgery detail fact I taken ring first time prior week Before leaving hospital I put small box Id given mother decade earlier taken back bookshelf died
I didnt tell boyfriend taken surgery crack dawn waited filled prescription brought home tucked bed I didnt tell cooked child school got ready basketball practice kept hair Or came ask anything I needed I said Can get ring
I didnt go fact I arent married explain I may like get married someday also I want nothing Both true
I didnt recount boyfriend retrieved box irreplaceable ring inside came back room handed I took ring put finger
Its wedding ring I didnt need tell
Need funny word

On College Basketball
By Marc Tracy
MINNEAPOLIS If defeat thirdseeded Texas Tech Monday night Virginia would become first national champion lost first round NCAA tournament previous year Duke 2015 Indiana 1987 Connecticut 2014 title year barred postseason play poor academic performance
But nonetheless win topseeded Virginia 343 would different Of course would different Not loss created equal Virginias tournament experience last year quite moment overcome
So many factor compounded last March make result Virginias game versus University Maryland Baltimore County awful Cavaliers There sheer history first No 1 seed ever lose No 16 seed men tournament There fact game close The Cavaliers lost 20 point There size fall Virginia top seed last year overall top seed deemed best team country day stunning exit And UMBC inspiring academic story clever Twitter feed underdog Cheseapake retriever precise straight central casting magnetic barely time feel bad Virginia team equivalent 20ton weight dropped
That day last March Charlotte NC time postgame news conference Coach Tony Bennett elected outgoing senior star Isaiah Wilkins Devon Hall join dais recalled Saturday night team barely defeated fifthseeded Auburn 6362 reach year final Instead tapped Kyle Guy Ty Jerome two sophomore knew would back
In end season Bennett implicitly declaring lay beginning next
You guy need message Guy Jerome said need go need go next year together
The Cavaliers coach since cared speak loss especially season began But course year tournament dealt slightly modified version exact question every step way Every round I say thing almost Jerome said Saturday feel little bit sweeter become clear last year still loom large team
The bad mojo seemed broken Virginias regionalfinal victory Purdue Virginia bound defeat missed free throw ball bounding backcourt led freshman point guard Kihei Clark make play tournament sending halfcourt pas Mamadi Diakite caught released swished ball buzzer force overtime period Virginia 5 point
But Auburn game happened Again Virginia trailed 2 point second left Only time Guy fouled 3pointer missed made three shot
Team destiny Or lucky
Is difference
Texas Tech 316 inspirational story A popular fact making round Red Raiders looked dominant defeating secondseeded Michigan State 6151 Saturday night win would second Division I men championship awarded team Lone Star State 1966 title Texas Western famously
But Texas Techs historic underachievement men basketball relevant narrative thread Virginia considered insufficiently blueblooded third Final Four By contrast year Texas Techs second round 8 The first last year That pretty neat
And even trajectory lack drama Virginias le figure Texas Tech Coach Chris Beard pointed Saturday night Like college basketball fan heartbreak last year playing national championship Monday night said story pull
The team present especially compelling contrast court Texas Tech play slow Virginia nobody play pretty slow Virginia relies 3pointers Texas Tech Texas Tech force turnover Virginia Virginia give far fewer turnover Texas Tech
Virginia better team NCAA tournament lost Duke supertalented team nightmare matchup Florida State Atlantic Coast Conference tournament Texas Tech bowed Big 12 tournament opening game West Virginia team losing record

MINNEAPOLIS Joshua Langford Michigan State guard remembered first time saw inch snow It two year ago freshman year East Lansing An Alabama native awoke one morning find campus absolutely covered stuff
Bro theyre probably going cancel class told roommate former Spartans star Miles Bridges
Recalling education winter Upper Midwest deadpanned week They didnt cancel class
These day Langford remains one odd men rare Michigan State player grow halfdays drive campus In fact 10 16 player roster year Spartans No 2 seed face thirdseeded Texas Tech national semifinal Saturday night played high school basketball state Michigan Among 12 player receiving scholarship seven
With Langford since January knee injury Spartans recent two game impressive win Louisiana State Duke featured Michiganders playing 57 percent minute
If could 13 guy Michigan thats Coach Izzo would like said Dwayne Stephens Michigan States associate head coach
Stephens Michigan two assistant recruiting coordinator Iron Mountains Tom Izzo
In Michigan dont publicity type thing said star point guard Cassius Winston junior Detroit You want come place like Michigan State youve got grind youve got work everything
Yet age national international recruiting prominent men basketball team public university dominated player goodsize state unusual one might think
Unlike football recruiting remained somewhat regional best basketball team day draw player everywhere Thanks summer league best player congregate April July showcase city near large airport front coach across country Even 10 12 prominent program country classification definitely includes Michigan State sign combined dozen player every year afford chase best
The instate talent comprising 625 percent Michigan State roster stand
At publicschool program similar pedigree Michigan State ratio tends much lower 3 15 Kansas 1 12 Kentucky two count walkon Brad Calipari coach son went high school New Jersey 6 17 North Carolina
Nor Big Ten occurrence At Ohio State equivalent figure 6 14 At Wisconsin 4 18 At Indiana 7 17
In fact semirandom assortment 20 prominent stateschool basketball team Washingtons Georgias instatetooutofstate ratio similar Michigan States Only 6 15 player Red Raiders roster Michigan State face Saturday Texas
The trend new For year Michigan States biggest star almost Mitten Staters Winston Michigans Mr Basketball University Detroit Jesuit High School Bridges 12th overall pick NBA draft last year Flint though played high school basketball several state Denzel Valentine Lansing Draymond Green Jason Richardson Saginaw
Dane Fife another Michigan State associate head coach former Michigan Mr Basketball son longtime high school coach Clarkston He said kinship among player locker room also includes two Ohioans one player Indiana real competitive advantage There sense loyalty school said
The biggest drawback focusing Michigan basketball recruiting condition Michigan basketball It seen better day
For one thing simply fewer people Michigan used The eighthlargest state population 1990 census likely drop 10th next year partly related travail auto industry In last five year best recruit state Michigan never ranked higher No 26 247Sportss composite ranking
Several Michigan State player coach said another problem Michigan High School Athletic Association rule limiting team traveling national tournament causing adverse impact Michigan high school basketball indirectly Michigan State recruiting
For instance Detroits Josh Jackson top class 2015 recruit nationally played prepschool basketball elsewhere single season Kansas
The MHSAA people run high school basketball old rule definitely need updated said freshman Foster Loyer last year Michigan Mr Basketball It causing higherlevel talent leave state
Mark Uyl state association executive director said interview several state similar travel rule Michigans case allow team travel neighboring state plus Illinois trip 300 mile one direction
The 748 high school make membership believe found pretty good balance letting school able travel find best competition Midwest keeping academic balance Uyl said
The Michigan State staff attitude toward rule pretty clear Hopefully Stephens said thing change
Another potential obstacle Michigan States ability recruit state actually become advantage This presence another public university one located proximately state population center gravity one considers far glamorous landgrant sibling
It possible heard University Michigan particularly ever met anyone went
But though Michigan two national championship game since Michigan State last appeared one Spartans nearly quartercentury Izzo Michigan States head coach national title made eight Final Fours never going five season without playing NCAA tournament final weekend
It may Wolverine State seven Michigans 16 player season four 12 scholarship player Michigan

Purging possession anatomy revealed I treasured
By Robin Troy
After Christmas last year boyfriend child exwife I went vacation daughter sunny spot far separate home Montana We together year sometimes blending childrens life sometimes feeling need I dont think define arrangement marriage
On trip stayed spare beach cottage I stared day sea four white bowl generously spaced along wooden shelf kitchen sink In wake another bloated Christmas simplicity bowl stood stark contrast clutter I left back home
By end vacation bowl never used part real life course burned hole brain within six hour return I thrown dozen garbage bag stuff I getting started I guided image four bowl also line old friend used say whenever I asked needed another beer Need funny word
Every day I threw stuff taking break walk dog I started laughing I acting ridiculous chucking anything didnt need I suddenly obsessed decluttering I scheduled surgery following week I scared As single parent simply could die I whatever I could distract risk lay ahead
No matter odds dying surgery minuscule I hysterectomy It another way unceremoniously throw away object I longer needed My mother done 40 I 44 child
She died 68 I 38 radiation damage cancer treatment decade earlier I wished I could talk mostly I trying keep busy I bad joke How could I seen I
As turned surgery breeze I back regular life time The next week walking dog trail near condo I pulled ball chase When I threw neighboring field filled nearly two foot snow ring I wear sailed finger vanished
I gasped My mother given ring time I taken surgery prior week I couldnt lose
I afraid move lest I disturb snow thinking surface indentation matter tiny might reveal ring landing spot I called boyfriend I called friend watching girl The three u collectively called halfdozen store tracked used metal detector pawnshop
My friend drove girl pick It 2 pm hour daylight left While I waited friend arrive metal detector pack parent child dog arrived crosscountry ski equipment Though I dazed remember I must told I lost ring I heard wondering aloud wedding ring
I didnt answer
An older woman another dog showed joined skiing crowd She talking loudly asking going I protecting snow dog wishing would leave silence mourn There way I would find
When skier left woman came said Is wedding ring
No I said sharply
A minute later man ran making eye contact way made think might know small town I didnt recognize He stopped running asked I right You look distraught said
I lost ring
Your wedding ring
No Im married I didnt mask exasperation
Id flustered He kind I sad He left I stared snow No ring No mother No husband Not even uterus How easy would dissolve pity party But reality I jazzed surgery In reality I love life family boyfriend
Why weddingring assumption keep setting On vacation nearly everyone met called boyfriend husband Talking another couple beach referred one child daughter Do need married I dont know Mostly boyfriend like say I want nothing
But I needed ring
The metal detector pawnshop juryrigged piece junk duct tape holding battery place item I would hauled dump day earlier My friend turned nothing happened
I getting frantic cold I left girl friend guard snow I drove buy new battery time another halfhour daylight wasted metal detector beeped life The metaldetecting needle didnt budge tested machine dropping penny snow beeped The sun lower I drained heartbeat
It seemed impossible cheap hunk plastic hand might produce miracle I took slow step field sweeping snow A crowd gathered The skier back My friend teenage son buddy arrived The kind runner actually run home showered driven back check unable shake upset I appeared
It didnt even take long 15 minute detector beeped I remained skeptical I figured picking metal zipper boot But faint beep persisted one spot I knelt poked finger snow ring
I burst tear I turned show crowd mostly stranger It felt little weird consider telling ring story invested time
My mom gave ring I 20 I said She diagnosed cancer 25 told year live She hadnt even gone first date dad When got engaged doctor told might five year They went anyway got married On 50th birthday threw big party refused present She gave ring day three band gold engraved name name dad She died 18 year later Ive never taken
Now handful stranger cry
I spared surgery detail fact I taken ring first time prior week Before leaving hospital I put small box Id given mother decade earlier taken back bookshelf died
I didnt tell boyfriend taken surgery crack dawn waited filled prescription brought home tucked bed I didnt tell cooked child school got ready basketball practice kept hair Or came ask anything I needed I said Can get ring
I didnt go fact I arent married explain I may like get married someday also I want nothing Both true
I didnt recount boyfriend retrieved box irreplaceable ring inside came back room handed I took ring put finger
Its wedding ring I didnt need tell
Need funny word

On College Basketball
By Marc Tracy
MINNEAPOLIS If defeat thirdseeded Texas Tech Monday night Virginia would become first national champion lost first round NCAA tournament previous year Duke 2015 Indiana 1987 Connecticut 2014 title year barred postseason play poor academic performance
But nonetheless win topseeded Virginia 343 would different Of course would different Not loss created equal Virginias tournament experience last year quite moment overcome
So many factor compounded last March make result Virginias game versus University Maryland Baltimore County awful Cavaliers There sheer history first No 1 seed ever lose No 16 seed men tournament There fact game close The Cavaliers lost 20 point There size fall Virginia top seed last year overall top seed deemed best team country day stunning exit And UMBC inspiring academic story clever Twitter feed underdog Cheseapake retriever precise straight central casting magnetic barely time feel bad Virginia team equivalent 20ton weight dropped
That day last March Charlotte NC time postgame news conference Coach Tony Bennett elected outgoing senior star Isaiah Wilkins Devon Hall join dais recalled Saturday night team barely defeated fifthseeded Auburn 6362 reach year final Instead tapped Kyle Guy Ty Jerome two sophomore knew would back
In end season Bennett implicitly declaring lay beginning next
You guy need message Guy Jerome said need go need go next year together
The Cavaliers coach since cared speak loss especially season began But course year tournament dealt slightly modified version exact question every step way Every round I say thing almost Jerome said Saturday feel little bit sweeter become clear last year still loom large team
The bad mojo seemed broken Virginias regionalfinal victory Purdue Virginia bound defeat missed free throw ball bounding backcourt led freshman point guard Kihei Clark make play tournament sending halfcourt pas Mamadi Diakite caught released swished ball buzzer force overtime period Virginia 5 point
But Auburn game happened Again Virginia trailed 2 point second left Only time Guy fouled 3pointer missed made three shot
Team destiny Or lucky
Is difference
Texas Tech 316 inspirational story A popular fact making round Red Raiders looked dominant defeating secondseeded Michigan State 6151 Saturday night win would second Division I men championship awarded team Lone Star State 1966 title Texas Western famously
But Texas Techs historic underachievement men basketball relevant narrative thread Virginia considered insufficiently blueblooded third Final Four By contrast year Texas Techs second round 8 The first last year That pretty neat
And even trajectory lack drama Virginias le figure Texas Tech Coach Chris Beard pointed Saturday night Like college basketball fan heartbreak last year playing national championship Monday night said story pull
The team present especially compelling contrast court Texas Tech play slow Virginia nobody play pretty slow Virginia relies 3pointers Texas Tech Texas Tech force turnover Virginia Virginia give far fewer turnover Texas Tech
Virginia better team NCAA tournament lost Duke supertalented team nightmare matchup Florida State Atlantic Coast Conference tournament Texas Tech bowed Big 12 tournament opening game West Virginia team losing record
In NCAA tournament though Texas Tech far better The Red Raiders five game including two No 2 seed topseeded Gonzaga average 14 point Cavaliers worse competition average victory margin nearly half half one count Purdue game regulation tie
But college basketball decide champion deciding best team If Virginia would last year national champion And Virginia chance year

MINNEAPOLIS Braxton Key Pittsburgh readying Alabamas secondround game Villanova evening last March 16 got upset alert phone Virginia trailing University Maryland Baltimore County
I like Theres way Theyre playing 16 seed Key recalled Monday night I turned game sure enough
Virginia seven still dont know lost 7454 first round last year NCAA tournament becoming first top seed lose bottom seed 33 year fullsize men bracket
Key texted condolence Virginias Kyle Guy friend summer basketball year past immediately He didnt text back couple day Key said I could understand
Alabama lost Villanova following day Villanova national championship Key cousin former Virginia great Ralph Sampson transferred Virginia got NCAA waiver letting play season
And Monday night essential contribution Key Virginia first national championship defeating Texas Tech overtime 8577 one year devastating infamous defeat
I thought work ethic drive whatever fueling u last year losing UMBC I thought good chance win Key said court amid confetti
Virginias trajectory last year year count among dramatic sport Its player coach Tony Bennett known anything short national championship season would credited last year devastating defeat
This particularly true team got No 1 seed program fourth six season In six game tournament Cavaliers team better seed There game supposed win even observer doubted every time It like walking tightrope made eggshell stretched thin ice
Not last year associate head coach Jason Williford said No one could thought wed
I dont know added Not two prior
Indeed Virginia make easy frayed nerve series closerthanclose contest tournament It trailed year No 16 seed GardnerWebb halftime It defeated Oregon No 12 seed 4 point Its regional final Purdue salvaged thanks freshman Kihei Clarks pas across half court Mamadi Diakite forced overtime quick shot Saturdays national semifinal victory Auburn came courtesy Guys fouled 3pointer second left hitting three free throw put team one
That left Monday night final Texas Tech outscored Virginia 10 last 10 minute Cavaliers kept alive DeAndre Hunters 3pointer 14 second left
Effectively Virginias sixth man Key important focal player season
But Monday night played 28 minute far higher season average 198 minute even accounting fiveminute overtime period
He quietly led team rebound 10 He halfblocked Texas Tech star Jarrett Culvers layup midway second half fully blocked Culvers shot end regulation preventing could buzzerbeater doom Cavaliers He nolook assisted Guy score late second half assisted Hunter 3pointer overtime
Keys plusminus statistic state score game minute player played 18 far highest
His role precisely part master plan least foreseeable eventuality according Virginia coach In many way came back UMBC
Last offseason Virginias coach saw Key talented highcharacter player tie program They saw 6foot8 jigsaw puzzle piece fit perfectly team taking shape departure senior Isaiah Wilkins Devon Hall
He provided skill needed assistant coach Brad Soderberg said We graduated Isaiah Wilkins We needed guy could rebound needed guy could handle ball size
In fact Soderberg said one game particular Virginias previous season pointed shortcoming came going small game five player none taller 65 shot 12 24 deep beat Virginia 20 college basketball historic loss
UMBC Soderberg said They played five guy smaller u hammered u
On Monday Texas Techs starting center Tariq Owens playing 100 percent sprained ankle Red Raiders elected go small playing lineup le size speed mobility countrybest defense typically deployed It part game lowscoring unexciting slugfest feared
Texas Techs tactical choice prompted Virginia go small well according Soderberg And meant many minute Key
Virginias 2018 humiliation 2019 triumph seem destined live tandem yin yang contextualizing balancing
Perhaps wedge separate two event player like Hunter Atlantic Coast Conference sixth man year last season led player Monday night careerhigh 27 point play UMBC game wrist injury Or player like Clark freshman Or Key arrived last summer substantial experience yet clean slate team still reeling previous March
I wish wouldnt happened way Bennett said UMBC loss Now I say well bought u ticket So
Key le ambivalent take Referring documentary series extraordinary sport happening said We definitely 30 30

This Connecticut star Shabazz Napier speaking news medium shortly 2014 national championship game said sometimes enough eat
There hungry night I go bed Im starving said

This commonsense reform work probably would occurred eventually But stark comment highprofile player NCAAs signature event ensured nearly immediate change boatload attention NCAAs power college athlete
It fruitful remember efficacy Napiers comment moment appears reform college sport muchmaligned policy amateurism come within The player foremost maybe even exclusive power agitate change
What would happened Zion Williamson said Nike shoe exploded jeopardizing career enough enough longer would wear shoe nothing coach least indirectly paid million Nike And player put hypocrisy either
The power labor player said Kain Colter former Northwestern quarterback led unionization drive among teammate several year ago

The antitrust lawsuit might allowed player profit use likeness video game medium ended extremely limited victory player
Last month second antitrust suit sought explode NCAAs ban compensation concluded districtcourt level technical victory player looked much like victory establishment A federal judge ruled NCAA could continue limit payment player directly related education

The final chapter Texas Tech basketball team season written Monday night Red Raiders play Virginia NCAA men national championship game But opening one set Circle 6 broad spread dusty plain long weekend early September
Back Red Raiders many way group player coach hardly knew one another Several team key player new So member coaching support staff The trip laid groundwork become
The whole point retreat really get know little bit better said guard Matt Mooney graduate transfer scored 22 point Saturday night win Michigan State Final Four Oftentimes hard really trust play play coach dont really know
So team bussed 15 mile nearest high school gym year first practice also sang karaoke hung bonfire walked along ledge buoyed trust teammate Everyone took part player coach manager staff member
One first exercise called everyones name put hat one one scrap paper pulled form pair Those tandem went walking around ranch getting know one another
Noah Parker freshman manager learned wife Tim McAllister hired last summer team chief staff college rifle coach Josh Mballa freshman born Detroit raised Bordeaux France learned graduate assistant Gino Saucedos dad similar experience coming Mexico kid The new assistant coach Glenn Cyprien learned mother one team manager battling cancer
These type exercise unique Texas Tech Virginias player hoot whitewater rafting trip At least except DeAndre Hunter cant swim And Texas Techs player hollered visited Upper Manhattans Rucker Park December team graduate assistant played impromptu pickup game
For Red Raiders though bonhomie engineered ranch cultivated ever since essential

It hard argue Texas Techs pegged seventh place Big 12 preseason vote
But Beard know like build fly
He coached junior college Division II Division III program spent year semiprofessional American Basketball Association summer coaching Switzerlands national team In one year ArkansasLittle Rock Beard took team 10 new player second round NCAA tournament
And fighting clock forge relationship Beard regularly ate lunch checked last summer Mooney Owens knowing important former scoring point guard latter shot blocking forward would team
Its arrogance truth really good coaching oneyear guy Beard said He added My experience professional basketball roster always change guy come contract leave I think there art

They lost meeting recently rolled past secondseeded Michigan thwarted topseeded Gonzaga staved Michigan State another No 2 seed
On Monday arrived championship game unforeseen occurrence team last season never reached regional final That Texas Tech could extra challenge Virginia Owens injured ankle Saturday night unable play effective almost seems beside point

Bookmakers set game overunder guess many total point scored somewhere 117 119 That lowest overunder since least early 1990s far back data available
The 2006 FloridaUCLA game 2010 DukeButler game previous low overunders full 10 point higher 128 sportsbettingag report The Florida game ended 130 point scored Duke game 120 total Only three time since 1991 final game gone 118
The reason low total year identity finalist Both play stifling defense
Texas Tech ranked first NCAA Division I defense allowing 865 point per 100 possession Virginia ranked sixth Texas Tech allowed opposing team shoot 368 percent field also best Division I Virginia fifth
The effect outstanding defense compounded Virginias glacial style play For fourth year row Virginia played slowest pace nation 608 possession per 40 minute In contrast North Carolina 759 possession Duke 732 Does sound like appetizing final
This expectation lowscoring game may seem incongruous era highscoring game college NBA helped along increase 3point shooting
But neither Mondays finalist especially like long ball Virginia took 3pointer 40 percent shot ranking 153rd Of 353 Division I team Texas Tech 36 percent 256th Villanova 54 percent ranked third Auburn 49 percent would provided exciting show distance
The lowestscoring final recent time came 2011 Connecticut beat Butler 5341 The New York Times proclaimed headline Connecticut Butler Saved Worst Last

I thinking I make said Hunter missed seven eight shot first half scored 22 point second Thats exactly I said head I shot It felt good It line And went

The Orioles first baseman 0 last 49 Why still lineup A Nobel Prizewinning economist explains flawed logic behind letting Daviss contract dictate playing time
By Benjamin Hoffman
On Sept 14 2018 Chris Davis hitless last 17 atbats got 21 changeup White Sox pitcher James Shields jumped Davis lined ball shift right field hustling way second double
Since day Davis 33yearold slugger Baltimore Orioles hit 53 home run season known nothing ignominy He went hitless final 21 atbats 2018 season clinching worst batting average qualified player major league history 168
On Monday made another dark entry record book After 0for5 performance Baltimores 124 win Oakland reached 49 consecutive atbats without hit breaking previous record 46 set Eugenio Velez across 2010 2011 season
The extraordinary run futility raise obvious question Why Orioles still putting Davis field When reporter asked exactly Mondays game Manager Brandon Hyde said He really wanted play today
In truth decision keep playing Davis almost certainly 17 million salary year 93 million Orioles owe beyond 2019 salary deferred payment team sending paycheck 2037 season Considering amount money team committed Davis situation might le suited manager like Hyde someone like Richard Thaler Nobel Prizewinning economist University Chicagos Booth School Business
To Thaler Orioless refusal sideline Davis classic example sunk cost fallacy economic principle detailed book Misbehaving The Making Behavioral Economics
A classic example order dessert restaurant cost 15 Thaler said phone interview You take couple bite realize already full dessert really rich feel like cant waste whole thing So eat
Ideally Thaler said correct decision ignore cost already paid evaluate situation strictly merit One favorite illustration sunk cost said deciding whether attend basketball game purchased ticket even though attending would mean traveling blizzard
The mistake people make thinking somehow using player eating dessert going game getting money back said Its Its making feel little better purchase turned good one
If Orioles waiting Davis pull tailspin ignoring fact player typically physical peak around 27 year old Daviss age 2013 53homer season inspired 161 million contract generally see decline performance In Daviss case immediate dip 2014 brief resurgence 2015 threeplus season since hit 199 1520 atbats onbase plus slugging percentage 684 adjusted home park 15 percent worse league average period
Unlike Velez previous record holder Bill Bergen 1909 Dave Campbell 1973 Craig Counsell 2011 0for45 streak Davis staying lineup glove He rated belowaverage fielder Sports Info Solutions previous two season meaning make living almost entirely bat And yet In last 56 plate appearance total offensive output consisted six walk two RBI 27 strikeout
Davis occasionally booed Baltimore season received mostly encouragement 6585 fan Camden Yards Monday number also set team record futility aside game 2015 fan admitted Hyde also continued look silver lining matter cloudy thing get
He hit three ball nose told reporter Mondays game though none contact resulted hit So Im taking positive moving forward Hopefully good start
Thaler channeling statistician Bill James correctly guessed Davis worth around minus3 win replacement last two year Baseball Reference minus28 last season yet release 2019 number That figure compound cost alreadybad deal Davis negative value taking roster spot playing time could given lowcost player minor league
Thaler acknowledged concept sunkcost fallacy easy one people comprehend many still convince ignore reality face hard decision push forward despite cost
In case sport team management may think suppose cut theyre going look like idiot said Of course whats true playing make look like bigger idiot
Thaler said believed owner would congratulate general manager willing admit mistake move along bad deal
Barring said Daviss example could used team better understand approach large deal future If team one keep player field matter team avoid longterm deal But said owner willing spend money well eat cost thing go south could rewarded would offer potential benefit without later compounding error
Davis play Tuesdays 132 loss Athletics Thaler belief team best bet moving forward go one step benching The team cut Davis replace minor leaguer even socalled replacement near average player would represent significant improvement
They could win let say two three game year cost half million said That would cheapest two three win could possibly buy That would like adding star

The internet famously terrible Try sometime youll see It designed coax neural pathway open state ecstatic receptivity dump horrible thing You hardly even need click These day much badness automatic It sprout edge otherwise innocuous page You enjoying sudden youll watching video conspiracy monger screaming people friedchicken restaurant basketball player snapping leg half sprinting athlete crashing onto track midstride genitals spilled short The online world interactive museum humiliation sadism greed bleak news bad faith gross meme
This need animal video They small window grace To watch baby rhino hopping mud cluster capybara sitting stoically hot tub momentarily exit tainted ecosystem human world A good animal video free political spin calculation It show u something blessedly pure creature wanting thing food fun dominance peace trying get Sometimes work sometimes doesnt A tortoise clatter across wooden floor pursuit purple ball The ball end cupboard A hedgehog look drunk pleasure human hand rub fat furry belly A young elephant harasses man trying paint fence Two ferret wrestle tiny hammock
Maybe best way say love animal dont use internet And favorite way see animal using internet watch video internet
My current favorite animal video went viral last month It depicts one planet earth elemental faceoffs bird versus cat On one side fang claw On superpower flight We know usually end either puff bloody feather lunge empty air
This time however twist The cat bird stand opposite side large pane glass The bird safe The cycle fight flight broken In space new possibility bloom
The bird Indian ringneck parrot named Oscar His feather tropical green roughly color unripe mango He stare cat expressionless yellow eye large black pupil The cat squint murderously back It pink nose wild hair shooting inside ear For first second predator prey sit balanced wonderful tension The cat seems pulsate menace It clearly want eat bird way root sharp feline teeth
The parrot gaze blankly expression unreadable Then open beak speak parrot sometimes say recordscratch voice single word Peekaboo Then duck view
For moment cat tail stop twitching Its prey apparently escaped But parrot pop back cat tail start twitching bird stare cat say brightly Peekaboo Then duck Then pop back Peekaboo say
The cat look briefly camera like character The Office
I watched video past couple week many dozen time It 22 second long also perfect loop clear beginning end let repeat delight last forever action stare single word end time Infinite peekaboo
What keep coming back animal video I think entertainment something deeper A great animal video force u grapple psychologist call theory mind ability learned child imagine way perspective others The video require u put least moment alien consciousness Why creature want want What know know How wanting like wanting
In case peekaboo parrot question run particularly deep A bird capacity laugh least understand laughter yet bird something indisputably funny pranking vicious predator inch away Does cat understand funny Does parrot How big gulf two different mind mind Even laugh video perform kind backoftheenvelope cognitive mapping It creates woozy uncanny existentialist feeling We simultaneously
Which brings u back festering horrorscape internet Animal video feel like delightful relief force u small way exercise theoryofmind muscle These creature enough like u identify much like u threatening Online people course different story altogether Social medium site notoriously flatten social interaction Human being typing thing onto distant screen easily become inhuman We go day time feeling mostly anger survey landscape like soldier bunker looking gun slit
Theoretically online world richest gallery human psychology ever assembled Tapping phone minute rough equivalent listening 300 million therapy session Every GIF retweet Reddit thread product long chain year decade generation psychodrama
And yet momenttomoment reality online life theory mind fritzes I find easier identify parrot playing peekaboo ferret stuck toiletpaper tube I loudest voice Twitter The internet great connector end atrophying basic connective skill imaginative leap another mind attempt understand know belief move way move
Not ever easy It take heroic investment time emotional intelligence sincerity mental effort At risk sounding like world tweediest professor I would like point local library contains million page designed help exactly problem Were going snap finger make one another humane But commercial internet seem aggressively engineered prevent u getting closer We online constantly looking yet rarely seen And instead watch animal Peekaboo

He stressed day dance hobby therapy As long lived New York also worked 9 5 messenger IBM computer operator among odd job
While developing minimalist style Judson beyond Mr Perez didnt fully part Graham root said He agreed Mr Petronios description work emotional theatrical Judson peer
He clarified Emotional yes place restrained
For writer Wendy Perron danced Mr Perez 196970 early work stood textural contrast He instinct would work next said Wed something rigid stiff suddenly wed bending picking flower dreamlike slow motion
There something sure magical onstage added

Because budgetary constraint Mr Petronio Mr Breton perform Coverage Revisited day rehearse directly Mr Perez October Los Angeles They acknowledged situation ideal Mr Breton additional rehearsal Sarah Swenson Mr Perezs assistant For Mr Perez crucial soloist shed dancerly affectation read guy man everyman dancer said For Juilliard graduate like Mr Breton take coaching
At recent rehearsal Mr Breton 28 appeared settling complex role regular person
A lot movement simple yet effortful said Theres something underneath every step
Mr Perez seemed reluctant share interpretation work But suggest Coverage deal certain duality everyman slip back white uniform Mr Perezs word conformist

As 201819 regular season dribble close two night 22 1230 game go voter leaguewide finalizing yearend award ballot six major category
I longer one The New York Times permit reporter vote award still useful exercise take stock season break race I would picked
Official selection due Friday night simply wrong answer choosing Antetokounmpo Houstons James Harden top spot fiveman MVP ballot
I always approached category trying identify best overall season based subjective imprecise mixture individual team success rather paying attention noise player widely regarded game best best twoway player designation
So better 201819 season I would go ever narrowly Giannis On top individual superlative Antetokounmpo face chief culturesetter Bucks transformation 44win underachiever best team league regularseason edition And candidacy get bonus point scorecard Milwaukee Eastern Conference supremacy beat trio worthy challenger projected superior season
Harden would tremendously unlucky finish second MVP balloting third time five season I think thats headed He going first scoring champion 361 point per game win scoring title eight point per game since Michael Jordan Dominique Wilkins 198687 And I tend agree Houston Coach Mike DAntonis contention Harden player capable hauling injuryriddled Rockets 53 victory 1114 hole Harden simply misfortune damage season belonged Antetokounmpo Bucks
It feel though I writing tweeting Doncic Atlanta Hawks counterpart Trae Young season I suspect I writing two next decadeplus And Im fine
Doncic starttofinish stronger campaign continued look like franchise player even though Mavericks steadily increased Year 1 workload trading away fourfifths starting lineup February The trade brought Kristaps Porzingis better position Dallas build supporting cast tailored electric European import
Young delivered even impressive postAllStar break production 249 point per game 91 assist per game scrappy Hawks team passable record 2329 since dismal 623 start increasingly bright future
Doncic going win race Young overcame worrisome launch make competition rivalry staying power secondhalf surge
Doncic remembered rookie NBA history named Oscar Robertson average least 20 point 7 rebound 5 assist And Young take solace almost unfortunate Harden doesnt win hardware Its quite compliment think
Had Indiana Pacers 50 game season Victor Oladipo healthy enough play 36 Nate McMillan would résumé deny Bucks Budenholzer Im sure McMillan mile 47 win
Doc Rivers Los Angeles Clippers like McMillan another victim bad timing Rivers hasnt team overachieve like starless Clippers since rookie season bench Orlando 19992000 Magic wholly unexpected 41 game season billed placeholder splashy freeagent summer ultimately landed Grant Hill Tracy McGrady Magic Kingdom

Johnsons forgettable coaching career Lakers lasted 16 game close 199394 season unhappily vowed never return occupation Then week Johnsons twoyear reign Lakers president basketball operation ended even ignominiously
He abruptly announced resignation team final game enormously disappointing season revealed told news medium decision informed bos Jeanie Buss order deny Buss opportunity talk

Rival frontoffice executive questioned Johnsons lack experience modern game willingness embrace allencompassing nature job moment named replace muchmaligned Jim Buss Jeanies brother Mitch Kupchak longtime Lakers executive Those question rose volume Buss named Magics sidekick another frontoffice neophyte Rob Pelinka Kobe Bryants polarizing former agent
There red flag start In taking first active role NBA team since second retirement player 1996 Johnson admitted much learn navigating in out NBAs complex salary cap rhythm job evolved much time away
The main part really learning part I didnt know understand CBA salary cap term salary cap who freeagenttobe Johnson told USA Today challenge faced building roster understanding collective bargaining agreement
Part issue might Johnson could never basketball executive He mogul cultural force While NBA team primarily lean decision maker focusing solely basketball Johnson seemed always eye something bigger game reaching business tentacle many corner possible
Johnson acquired 45 percent share Lakers 1994 selling stake 2010 He even hosted syndicated latenight talk show 1998s The Magic Hour And never one game either acquiring minority stake Dodgers 2012 one Los Angeles Football Club Major League Soccer 2014

I retire happy career Wade would say sporting gold black jacket interview room way dance night away guest list included NBA brotherhood LeBron James Carmelo Anthony Chris Paul
However dapper 74 fine head combedback gray hair Riley never part social scene patriarch landed Wade fifth pick 2003 draft considered time consolation prize James Darko Milicic Anthony Chris Bosh first four player chosen
But Wade special anyone imagined time Marquette worldclass gymnast basketball footwear uncommon calm cocksure gunslinger
When Wade moved corridor leading locker room I told Riley 2005 playoff night Auburn Hills Mich Wade secondyear player making life quite difficult defending champion defensively stout Detroit Pistons Eastern Conference final
Taking halftime stroll I ran Chuck Daly Pistons coach late 1980s devised defense specifically Michael Jordan famous Jordan Rules
Ill tell he got Jordan Daly said dragging cigarette I asked thought young Wade Hes got thing cant teach
Riley nodded Chuck right said
Wade elite quality besides balletic ability score angle couldnt sure actually existed He could pas like point guard team needed assist He solid team defender He retires productive shotblocking guard NBA history last month nudged past Jordan
Flashy Wade Tim Duncan Until James arrived Bosh summer 2010 unquestionably franchise star without broadcast world door open anyone could give better chance win
Wade embraced Rileys 2004 acquisition Shaquille ONeal Kobe Bryant wanted part big fella Los Angeles He recruited James fully aware selfproclaimed King great basketball well sucking oxygen organization
When James departed two title four consecutive run final Riley called devastating blow time Miami Wade insisted hard feeling It business He still paid play basketball live Miami How could life good
Yet wasnt immune wounded pride Riley refused give third contract year 2016 citing Wades balky knee declining stats Wade left reluctantly one divorce league evertransient star
Theres nothing wrong nothing player maximizing free agency leveraging way whichever location suit certain career stage James course pied piper paradigm Kevin Durant reportedly poised follow lead right Golden State
But Jamess presence Brooklyn Wednesday night convenient excuse avoiding dealing Magic Johnsons sudden stunning disappearance Lakers front office reminder move player make better odds might eventually outmaneuver

I like Theres way Theyre playing 16 seed Key recalled Monday night I turned game sure enough
Virginia seven still dont know lost 7454 first round last year NCAA tournament becoming first top seed lose bottom seed 33 year fullsize men bracket
Key texted condolence Virginias Kyle Guy friend summer basketball year past immediately He didnt text back couple day Key said I could understand
Alabama lost Villanova following day Villanova national championship Key cousin former Virginia great Ralph Sampson transferred Virginia got NCAA waiver letting play season
And Monday night essential contribution Key Virginia first national championship defeating Texas Tech overtime 8577 one year devastating infamous defeat
I thought work ethic drive whatever fueling u last year losing UMBC I thought good chance win Key said court amid confetti
Virginias trajectory last year year count among dramatic sport Its player coach Tony Bennett known anything short national championship season would credited last year devastating defeat
This particularly true team got No 1 seed program fourth six season In six game tournament Cavaliers team better seed There game supposed win even observer doubted every time It like walking tightrope made eggshell stretched thin ice
Not last year associate head coach Jason Williford said No one could thought wed
I dont know added Not two prior
Indeed Virginia make easy frayed nerve series closerthanclose contest tournament It trailed year No 16 seed GardnerWebb halftime It defeated Oregon No 12 seed 4 point Its regional final Purdue salvaged thanks freshman Kihei Clarks pas across half court Mamadi Diakite forced overtime quick shot Saturdays national semifinal victory Auburn came courtesy Guys fouled 3pointer second left hitting three free throw put team one
That left Monday night final Texas Tech outscored Virginia 10 last 10 minute Cavaliers kept alive DeAndre Hunters 3pointer 14 second left
Effectively Virginias sixth man Key important focal player season
But Monday night played 28 minute far higher season average 198 minute even accounting fiveminute overtime period
He quietly led team rebound 10 He halfblocked Texas Tech star Jarrett Culvers layup midway second half fully blocked Culvers shot end regulation preventing could buzzerbeater doom Cavaliers He nolook assisted Guy score late second half assisted Hunter 3pointer overtime
Keys plusminus statistic state score game minute player played 18 far highest
His role precisely part master plan least foreseeable eventuality according Virginia coach In many way came back UMBC
Last offseason Virginias coach saw Key talented highcharacter player tie program They saw 6foot8 jigsaw puzzle piece fit perfectly team taking shape departure senior Isaiah Wilkins Devon Hall
He provided skill needed assistant coach Brad Soderberg said We graduated Isaiah Wilkins We needed guy could rebound needed guy could handle ball size
In fact Soderberg said one game particular Virginias previous season pointed shortcoming came going small game five player none taller 65 shot 12 24 deep beat Virginia 20 college basketball historic loss
UMBC Soderberg said They played five guy smaller u hammered u
On Monday Texas Techs starting center Tariq Owens playing 100 percent sprained ankle Red Raiders elected go small playing lineup le size speed mobility countrybest defense typically deployed It part game lowscoring unexciting slugfest feared
Texas Techs tactical choice prompted Virginia go small well according Soderberg And meant many minute Key
Virginias 2018 humiliation 2019 triumph seem destined live tandem yin yang contextualizing balancing
Perhaps wedge separate two event player like Hunter Atlantic Coast Conference sixth man year last season led player Monday night careerhigh 27 point play UMBC game wrist injury Or player like Clark freshman Or Key arrived last summer substantial experience yet clean slate team still reeling previous March
I wish wouldnt happened way Bennett said UMBC loss Now I say well bought u ticket So
Key le ambivalent take Referring documentary series extraordinary sport happening said We definitely 30 30

On Monday made another dark entry record book After 0for5 performance Baltimores 124 win Oakland reached 49 consecutive atbats without hit breaking previous record 46 set Eugenio Velez across 2010 2011 season
The extraordinary run futility raise obvious question Why Orioles still putting Davis field When reporter asked exactly Mondays game Manager Brandon Hyde said He really wanted play today
In truth decision keep playing Davis almost certainly 17 million salary year 93 million Orioles owe beyond 2019 salary deferred payment team sending paycheck 2037 season Considering amount money team committed Davis situation might le suited manager like Hyde someone like Richard Thaler Nobel Prizewinning economist University Chicagos Booth School Business
To Thaler Orioless refusal sideline Davis classic example sunk cost fallacy economic principle detailed book Misbehaving The Making Behavioral Economics
A classic example order dessert restaurant cost 15 Thaler said phone interview You take couple bite realize already full dessert really rich feel like cant waste whole thing So eat
Ideally Thaler said correct decision ignore cost already paid evaluate situation strictly merit One favorite illustration sunk cost said deciding whether attend basketball game purchased ticket even though attending would mean traveling blizzard
The mistake people make thinking somehow using player eating dessert going game getting money back said Its Its making feel little better purchase turned good one
If Orioles waiting Davis pull tailspin ignoring fact player typically physical peak around 27 year old Daviss age 2013 53homer season inspired 161 million contract generally see decline performance In Daviss case immediate dip 2014 brief resurgence 2015 threeplus season since hit 199 1520 atbats onbase plus slugging percentage 684 adjusted home park 15 percent worse league average period
Unlike Velez previous record holder Bill Bergen 1909 Dave Campbell 1973 Craig Counsell 2011 0for45 streak Davis staying lineup glove He rated belowaverage fielder Sports Info Solutions previous two season meaning make living almost entirely bat And yet In last 56 plate appearance total offensive output consisted six walk two RBI 27 strikeout
Davis occasionally booed Baltimore season received mostly encouragement 6585 fan Camden Yards Monday number also set team record futility aside game 2015 fan admitted Hyde also continued look silver lining matter cloudy thing get
He hit three ball nose told reporter Mondays game though none contact resulted hit So Im taking positive moving forward Hopefully good start
Thaler channeling statistician Bill James correctly guessed Davis worth around minus3 win replacement last two year Baseball Reference minus28 last season yet release 2019 number That figure compound cost alreadybad deal Davis negative value taking roster spot playing time could given lowcost player minor league
Thaler acknowledged concept sunkcost fallacy easy one people comprehend many still convince ignore reality face hard decision push forward despite cost
In case sport team management may think suppose cut theyre going look like idiot said Of course whats true playing make look like bigger idiot
Thaler said believed owner would congratulate general manager willing admit mistake move along bad deal
Barring said Daviss example could used team better understand approach large deal future If team one keep player field matter team avoid longterm deal But said owner willing spend money well eat cost thing go south could rewarded would offer potential benefit without later compounding error
Davis play Tuesdays 132 loss Athletics Thaler belief team best bet moving forward go one step benching The team cut Davis replace minor leaguer even socalled replacement near average player would represent significant improvement
They could win let say two three game year cost half million said That would cheapest two three win could possibly buy That would like adding star

The internet famously terrible Try sometime youll see It designed coax neural pathway open state ecstatic receptivity dump horrible thing You hardly even need click These day much badness automatic It sprout edge otherwise innocuous page You enjoying sudden youll watching video conspiracy monger screaming people friedchicken restaurant basketball player snapping leg half sprinting athlete crashing onto track midstride genitals spilled short The online world interactive museum humiliation sadism greed bleak news bad faith gross meme
This need animal video They small window grace To watch baby rhino hopping mud cluster capybara sitting stoically hot tub momentarily exit tainted ecosystem human world A good animal video free political spin calculation It show u something blessedly pure creature wanting thing food fun dominance peace trying get Sometimes work sometimes doesnt A tortoise clatter across wooden floor pursuit purple ball The ball end cupboard A hedgehog look drunk pleasure human hand rub fat furry belly A young elephant harasses man trying paint fence Two ferret wrestle tiny hammock
Maybe best way say love animal dont use internet And favorite way see animal using internet watch video internet
My current favorite animal video went viral last month It depicts one planet earth elemental faceoffs bird versus cat On one side fang claw On superpower flight We know usually end either puff bloody feather lunge empty air
This time however twist The cat bird stand opposite side large pane glass The bird safe The cycle fight flight broken In space new possibility bloom
The bird Indian ringneck parrot named Oscar His feather tropical green roughly color unripe mango He stare cat expressionless yellow eye large black pupil The cat squint murderously back It pink nose wild hair shooting inside ear For first second predator prey sit balanced wonderful tension The cat seems pulsate menace It clearly want eat bird way root sharp feline teeth
The parrot gaze blankly expression unreadable Then open beak speak parrot sometimes say recordscratch voice single word Peekaboo Then duck view
For moment cat tail stop twitching Its prey apparently escaped But parrot pop back cat tail start twitching bird stare cat say brightly Peekaboo Then duck Then pop back Peekaboo say
The cat look briefly camera like character The Office
I watched video past couple week many dozen time It 22 second long also perfect loop clear beginning end let repeat delight last forever action stare single word end time Infinite peekaboo
What keep coming back animal video I think entertainment something deeper A great animal video force u grapple psychologist call theory mind ability learned child imagine way perspective others The video require u put least moment alien consciousness Why creature want want What know know How wanting like wanting
In case peekaboo parrot question run particularly deep A bird capacity laugh least understand laughter yet bird something indisputably funny pranking vicious predator inch away Does cat understand funny Does parrot How big gulf two different mind mind Even laugh video perform kind backoftheenvelope cognitive mapping It creates woozy uncanny existentialist feeling We simultaneously

I always approached category trying identify best overall season based subjective imprecise mixture individual team success rather paying attention noise player widely regarded game best best twoway player designation
So better 201819 season I would go ever narrowly Giannis On top individual superlative Antetokounmpo face chief culturesetter Bucks transformation 44win underachiever best team league regularseason edition And candidacy get bonus point scorecard Milwaukee Eastern Conference supremacy beat trio worthy challenger projected superior season
Harden would tremendously unlucky finish second MVP balloting third time five season I think thats headed He going first scoring champion 361 point per game win scoring title eight point per game since Michael Jordan Dominique Wilkins 198687 And I tend agree Houston Coach Mike DAntonis contention Harden player capable hauling injuryriddled Rockets 53 victory 1114 hole Harden simply misfortune damage season belonged Antetokounmpo Bucks
It feel though I writing tweeting Doncic Atlanta Hawks counterpart Trae Young season I suspect I writing two next decadeplus And Im fine
Doncic starttofinish stronger campaign continued look like franchise player even though Mavericks steadily increased Year 1 workload trading away fourfifths starting lineup February The trade brought Kristaps Porzingis better position Dallas build supporting cast tailored electric European import
Young delivered even impressive postAllStar break production 249 point per game 91 assist per game scrappy Hawks team passable record 2329 since dismal 623 start increasingly bright future
Doncic going win race Young overcame worrisome launch make competition rivalry staying power secondhalf surge
Doncic remembered rookie NBA history named Oscar Robertson average least 20 point 7 rebound 5 assist And Young take solace almost unfortunate Harden doesnt win hardware Its quite compliment think
Had Indiana Pacers 50 game season Victor Oladipo healthy enough play 36 Nate McMillan would résumé deny Bucks Budenholzer Im sure McMillan mile 47 win
Doc Rivers Los Angeles Clippers like McMillan another victim bad timing Rivers hasnt team overachieve like starless Clippers since rookie season bench Orlando 19992000 Magic wholly unexpected 41 game season billed placeholder splashy freeagent summer ultimately landed Grant Hill Tracy McGrady Magic Kingdom
But Milwaukees improvement Budenholzers first season dramatic I cant see doesnt win second Coach Year trophy Perhaps voter try convince Bucks would getting much love vote Giannis MVP Bud honor But talking league 60win team runaway champion average point differential season 91 team league rank top five offensive defensive efficiency
Antetokounmpo biggest reason possible General Manager Jon Horst likewise impressive run roster move But Budenholzers impact undeniable
Honorable mention along McMillan Rivers Denvers Mike Malone Brooklyns Kenny Atkinson Portlands Terry Stotts Orlandos Steve Clifford Detroits Dwane Casey Golden States Steve Kerr course San Antonios Gregg Popovich
Manu Ginobili familiar No 20 retired San Antonio Spurs used synonymous sixth man excellence Ditto Jamal Crawford
Yet Id say Williams wear crown
The Clippers designated scorer award last season stand huge favorite join Crawford league threetime winner despite challenge he getting teammate Montrezl Harrell
Someone Clippers win yearend recognition light Cinderella season theyve assembled Williams make sense quality field also feature Harrell Indianas Domantas Sabonis Brooklyns Spencer Dinwiddie New Orleans Julius Randle San Antonios Davis Bertans

But Ive saying year ultrahigh former draft pick like Russell secondyear player like Fox going Most Improved candidate Russell made tremendous inspiring leap AllStar status Brooklyn season wow factor partly stem fact fell far short expectation first three season Fox meanwhile made sort Year 1toYear 2 leap Sacramento counting someone billed franchise cornerstone
No one expected Siakam become impact player end borderline AllStar helped Raptors post 57 win amid 22 game Kawhi Leonard missed various reason injury precaution
The nostalgic sap truth told wanted go Minnesotas resurgent Derrick Rose But DRose wound healthy enough appear 51 game former MVP he Comeback Player Year Most Improved candidate The NBAs specific instruction category read follows This award designed honor upandcoming player made dramatic improvement previous season season It intended given player made comeback

It one oldest warning sport Great athlete say dont often become great coach
In case Magic Johnson legendary former Los Angeles Lakers point guard maxim must amended For Johnson neither front office bench proved winning even comfortable habitat like hardwood used launching pad basketball immortality
Johnsons forgettable coaching career Lakers lasted 16 game close 199394 season unhappily vowed never return occupation Then week Johnsons twoyear reign Lakers president basketball operation ended even ignominiously
He abruptly announced resignation team final game enormously disappointing season revealed told news medium decision informed bos Jeanie Buss order deny Buss opportunity talk
Johnson course stunned world announcement early retirement 1991 found HIV positive followed brief return basketball 1996 He spent ensuing two decade constructing business entertainment empire replete highly successful chain movie theater ownership stake storied Los Angeles Dodgers But Johnson always insisted first foremost Laker
Handling exit haphazard manner earned Johnson untold amount criticism day since given much Lakers mean Southern Californians unexpected news Yet seems prepared take hit exchange opportunity return customary postplaying life side described forever Laker officially unattached team

When convened impromptu news conference Tuesday night rather reveal updated plan restore Lakers title contention placate frustrated fan base Johnson opposite Describing happier I wasnt president explained condition pressure attached building championship team around James meant real Magic couldnt come
In series rambling interview number news outlet Lakers process losing regularseason finale Portland Trail Blazers Johnson spoke longed send congratulatory tweet Oklahoma Citys Russell Westbrook tutor Ben Simmons rising Philadelphia 76ers star without inciting storm tampering allegation
I knew I stayed role said Im giving lot
Such disclosure course served validate much skepticism greeted Busss decision install Johnson new face Lakers basketball operation February 2017
Rival frontoffice executive questioned Johnsons lack experience modern game willingness embrace allencompassing nature job moment named replace muchmaligned Jim Buss Jeanies brother Mitch Kupchak longtime Lakers executive Those question rose volume Buss named Magics sidekick another frontoffice neophyte Rob Pelinka Kobe Bryants polarizing former agent
There red flag start In taking first active role NBA team since second retirement player 1996 Johnson admitted much learn navigating in out NBAs complex salary cap rhythm job evolved much time away
The main part really learning part I didnt know understand CBA salary cap term salary cap who freeagenttobe Johnson told USA Today challenge faced building roster understanding collective bargaining agreement
Part issue might Johnson could never basketball executive He mogul cultural force While NBA team primarily lean decision maker focusing solely basketball Johnson seemed always eye something bigger game reaching business tentacle many corner possible
Johnson acquired 45 percent share Lakers 1994 selling stake 2010 He even hosted syndicated latenight talk show 1998s The Magic Hour And never one game either acquiring minority stake Dodgers 2012 one Los Angeles Football Club Major League Soccer 2014
Business clearly Johnsons mind took Lakers frontoffice job 2017 He told CBS This Morning interview time turned offer run franchise including embattled Knicks felt right time rejoin Lakers
At point life know I think I right business running smooth Johnson said I turn executive team I In interview said I always wanted male Oprah
Johnson one first athlete build empire outside professional sport He went whipping behindtheback pass engine made 1980s Showtime Lakers rev investing 100 Starbucks Burger King location among many business investment flashing famed charismatic grin According Basketball Reference estimate Johnson made 23 million NBA salary alone including endorsement Now net worth hundred million
The business reviving Lakers however proved beyond Buss result already facing pressure rebound nostalgic faith Johnson pursue accomplished executive time Golden States Bob Myers San Antonios R C Buford plot team recovery season soaked drama dysfunction
Bizarre timing seemed Johnson insisted reporter hidden reason leaving desire put ESPNs Rachel Nichols stop letting Magic Johnson
Whats clear walking away spared firing Coach Luke Walton something Walton assistant coach according two people knowledge situation authorized discus publicly bracing week Waltons culpability Lakers 3745 record matter debate given season injury Johnsons desire make change widely anticipated league circle week month Busss wellchronicled fondness Walton thought thing kept place throughout Johnsons reign

There never player like Johnson drafted Michigan State first pick 1979 NBA draft His court vision quickness length versatility made dominant presence led winning three Most Valuable Player Awards five NBA championship He became perhaps defining face mean Laker easy feat given deep well great player worn familiar purpleandgold jersey
But fact Buss yet address news medium beyond brief statement insisting organization still believed greater Los Angeles Laker Earvin Johnson speaks team level shock would step without warning

Now onus fall squarely Buss find successor repair roster need overhaul
To Johnsons relief issue longer concern He return world may felt increasingly comfortable anyway recent year one outside basketball As told The Los Angeles Times 2008 Johnson hoped go history better businessman athlete
Thats dream Johnson said And Im going every day

Whoa Riley said hand shoulder wife Chris steadying swell humanity
Now finally came Wade man hour Wade Riley standing 6 foot 4 inch made eye contact Riley raised right arm forward Wade reached security detail clasping hand team president The linchpin Miami Heat franchise pulled together heartfelt embrace
One Riley told Wade Ive got max contract

However dapper 74 fine head combedback gray hair Riley never part social scene patriarch landed Wade fifth pick 2003 draft considered time consolation prize James Darko Milicic Anthony Chris Bosh first four player chosen
But Wade special anyone imagined time Marquette worldclass gymnast basketball footwear uncommon calm cocksure gunslinger
When Wade moved corridor leading locker room I told Riley 2005 playoff night Auburn Hills Mich Wade secondyear player making life quite difficult defending champion defensively stout Detroit Pistons Eastern Conference final
Taking halftime stroll I ran Chuck Daly Pistons coach late 1980s devised defense specifically Michael Jordan famous Jordan Rules
Ill tell he got Jordan Daly said dragging cigarette I asked thought young Wade Hes got thing cant teach
Riley nodded Chuck right said
Wade elite quality besides balletic ability score angle couldnt sure actually existed He could pas like point guard team needed assist He solid team defender He retires productive shotblocking guard NBA history last month nudged past Jordan
Flashy Wade Tim Duncan Until James arrived Bosh summer 2010 unquestionably franchise star without broadcast world door open anyone could give better chance win
Wade embraced Rileys 2004 acquisition Shaquille ONeal Kobe Bryant wanted part big fella Los Angeles He recruited James fully aware selfproclaimed King great basketball well sucking oxygen organization
When James departed two title four consecutive run final Riley called devastating blow time Miami Wade insisted hard feeling It business He still paid play basketball live Miami How could life good
Yet wasnt immune wounded pride Riley refused give third contract year 2016 citing Wades balky knee declining stats Wade left reluctantly one divorce league evertransient star
Theres nothing wrong nothing player maximizing free agency leveraging way whichever location suit certain career stage James course pied piper paradigm Kevin Durant reportedly poised follow lead right Golden State
But Jamess presence Brooklyn Wednesday night convenient excuse avoiding dealing Magic Johnsons sudden stunning disappearance Lakers front office reminder move player make better odds might eventually outmaneuver
Meanwhile Dirk Nowitzki like Wade also demonstrating currency continuity finishing 21year run Wednesday night Dallas Mavericks widespread acclaim Manu Ginobili Duncan similarly deified staying course San Antonio Wade remain toast South Florida
In Miami locker room young Heat player lined Wade sign jersey sneaker The No 3 jersey wore given Anthony shooter without squad parting way Pauls Houston Rockets season mere 10 game
Anthony manage scoop ball rolling bound fourth quarter corner front row Paul James cheering Wade He took one dribble thankfully resisted temptation
I didnt get chance play Melo season exchange jersey said Wade explaining gesture He missing piece
Throughout career wherever lit scoreboard Anthony seemed miss point unwilling former President Barack Obama said Wade video tribute sometimes sacrifice ego pursuit title
If Anthony never play NBA moral divergent story Only graceful departure possible priority part plan It apparently Wade He left selfassured smile indicating would probably need therapy deal time hand ruled potential return

The NBA season unofficially began superstar trade demand superstar question Jimmy Butler team time Minnesota even convened training camp
Seven month 1200 game later Magic Johnson upstaged retirement two legend Dirk Nowitzki Dwyane Wade unbecoming fashion abruptly walking away Jeanie Buss LeBron James rest Los Angeles Lakers chaotic hour unscheduled interview news medium
And countless drama controversy bookend Houston Rockets poor start nearinstant divorce Carmelo Anthony sad disintegration New Orleans Pelicans season Anthony Daviss trade demand Lakers injurydriven collapse ultimately prevented King James reaching postseason first time 14 year
Regular season Hardly From Butlers trade request Fridays announcement Lakers parting way Coach Luke Walton exhausting ride Yet weve finally arrived wanted along Saturdays start playoff
The overriding question step roller coaster onto another remains Golden Statecentric fourth successive spring
Can anyone beat Warriors four time sevengame series
My answer remains firm But make postseason unlike beyond LeBrons absence array ancillary question sure sprout future Warriors many team chasing
Only 80 day away remember July 1 start freeagent frenzy bound strongly influenced playoff result The principal Golden States Kevin Durant Klay Thompson DeMarcus Cousins Bostons Kyrie Irving Torontos Kawhi Leonard Philadelphias Tobias Harris Butler Milwaukees Khris Middleton Charlottes Kemba Walker Orlandos Nikola Vucevic
Just name 10 past present future AllStars
I think summer going pivotal time NBA history said Charles Barkley Turner Sports Hall Fame analyst Its going dictate next five year
Any chance Raptors persuading Leonard stay Canada month noise suggesting Los Angeles Clippers frontrunners sign would seem depend run NBA final The Raptors indeed pick get winning postLeBron East high stake involved along Torontos tortured playoff history weigh heavily team despite potential defensive juggernaut
The pressure even tangible Philadelphia thanks 76ers allin trade Harris Butler Those two along sharpshooting J J Redick free agentstobe Its lot Sixers Coach Brett Brown manage especially best player Joel Embiid may available start Philadelphias firstround series Nets knee issue lingered since AllStar Game Whispers Browns job security result starting circulate
Uncertainty likewise smother Celtics failed even win 50 game openly grappled chemistry issue finding reintegration Irving Gordon Hayward former AllStar swingman far complicated anyone Boston official included expected Fears tworound injury absence rugged guard Marcus Smart dont help looming specter Irvings free agency possible trade pursuit Davis adding tension
Milwaukee meanwhile statistical profile team heavily favored represent East final potentially take Warriors except fact next playoff series otherworldly Giannis Antetokounmpo first The Bucks team league ranked top five offensive defensive efficiency I confess one oldschool pundit hung lack biggame experience
Denver Wests answer Milwaukee proof No 2 seed uplifting tale celebrate amid transactional chaos personality conflict tend dominate league slice social medium universe But Nuggets inexperience didnt steer away naming Warriors top threat conference make vulnerable Round 1 San Antonio
Its Houston stand team capable derailing Warriors bid threepeat Houstons problem costly slip No 4 seed West dropped Golden States half playoff bracket The Rockets must face Utah Jazz firstround matchup featuring hottest Houston went 205 thirdhottest Utah went 187 team since AllStar break
For talk Rockets may benefit rematch Warriors conference semifinal rather West final James Harden Chris Paul theoretically fresher may actually Golden State benefit watching Houston Utah beating early
The Warriors wont refuse help either veteran coach would undoubtedly argue regularseason grind longer anyones four consecutive trip championship round Ceaseless speculation Durants potential freeagent defection Knicks Nets yes Im indeed warning sleep Brooklyn added Coach Steve Kerrs daily challenge keep team focused
Another warning Dont forget Warriors tend find focus quickly calendar flip postseason So many last 82 game billed uncharacteristically joyless Golden State 326 playoff since adding Durant
As long Stephen Currys ankle scare earlier week scare prof minor appeared bank Warriors become first team 52 season 744 team reach playoff time make fifth straight final appearance And snag title No 4 cement indisputably dynastic

Extra Bases
By Tyler Kepner
The Tampa Bay Rays arrived Toronto weekend winning record American League East They 103 entering Fridays game 198 team earned run average easily best major league
And used opener twice Creating position opener essentially reliever start game work inning two helped Rays surge 90 victory last season But notion Tampa Bay intended blow pitching know always misguided
The Rays AL Cy Young Award winner last season Blake Snell signed fiveyear 50 million contract extension March Their No 2 starter Charlie Morton signed free agent December earn 15 million season next highest salary team history
Their third fourth starter Tyler Glasnow Yonny Chirinos 25 combined go 50 first five start allowing two run 29 inning 32 strikeout four walk
So yes Rays believe elite starting pitching They believe mediocre pitching kind much far
We tried put position lot interesting depth said Chaim Bloom Rays senior vice president baseball operation Theres lot guy great upside
Morton 35 took year realize upside young pitcher Atlanta Pittsburgh He finally discovered Houston Astros learned attack hitter curveballs high fastball instead trying induce contact sinker He Game 7 American League Championship Series World Series 2017 earned first AllStar selection last season
Morton love traditional role starting pitcher
I grew idolizing starting pitcher fan standpoint someone thats starter whole career essentially I would like see starting pitcher always place game Morton said Theres balance poetic nature game nostalgic part game flow mystical part winloss part win Were trying find balance
Last summer trading Chris Archer Pittsburgh Glasnow outfielder Austin Meadows Nathan Eovaldi Boston Rays found balance regular use opener allowing pitcher like Chirinos Ryan Yarbrough work bulk game reliever gone tough hitter start
Chirinos pitched four seven inning last 10 appearance last season without starting game His ERA game 304 Yarbrough went 166 started six time The Rays adjust role season based matchup maximize chance success avoid dreaded mediocrity
The Yankees Boston Red Sox always significant financial edge Rays whose 60 million payroll le combined 2019 salary Yankees Giancarlo Stanton Masahiro Tanaka Jacoby Ellsbury
But Tampa Bay supplementing major league roster product farm system Baseball America ranked No 2 game San Diegos Shortstop Wander Franco pitcher Brent Honeywell twoway player Brendan McKay rank among MLBcoms top 30 prospect
Thats Bloom said Weve put lot effort last year making sure system deep robust possible We need depth need topend talent need steady flow championshipcaliber player put lot energy focus
It early course young player helped Rays open biggest lead AL East since midMay 2011 led two half game
Their current player major league roster Morton naturally With home Bradenton Fla four young child found perfect spot contract said would last career
I didnt know expect historically Rays havent spent lot money freeagent starting pitching ever Morton said So I wasnt thinking Im guy When called got impression going pretty aggressive I started get excited wife got excited We tried get hope knew ideal situation But work way kind unbelievable
Kramer Robertson 10 year old 2005 first time cut basketball net celebrate NCAA championship Baylor Lady Bears The second time 2012 17
Last Sunday though grown playing Springfield Cardinals Class AA team St Louis farm system Robertson could Tampa Fla national title game mother Kim Mulkey Baylor coach sister Makenzie Fuller associate director team operation
Instead Robertson Cardinals team bus halfway Fayetteville Ark Tulsa Okla huddled teammate around phone streaming broadcast Just minute tipoff Mulkey sent text message game Now watching exulting afar Lady Bears beat Notre Dame thriller 8281
We middle nowhere barely service I fired Robertson shortstop said phone day The first thing I thought FaceTime brotherinlaw I expecting answer I excited I wanted bad But said Connecting first face I saw mom I didnt know say I started screaming
Robertsons brotherinlaw Clay Fuller former minor leaguer Los Angeles Angels His father Randy Robertson former quarterback Louisiana Tech Kim Mulkey AllAmerican point guard She coached Baylor since 2000 turning around team went 720 season arrived setting powerful example son
Ive seen shes handled failure success humility never wavered moral said She always taught Nothing great ever get done without enthusiasm Ive remembered throughout baseball career especially minor league get monotonous easy get complacent
There little chance Tuesday Tulsa Drillers started Clayton Kershaw threetime Cy Young Award winner making rehabilitation start recovers shoulder soreness Kershaw scheduled start Los Angeles Dodgers Monday pitched five shutout inning Robertson led sixth home run high fastball
It first homer season Robertson gave highlight memorable week family Back home Texas mother watching
I got phone mom excited Robertson said She like No didnt Normally I would try play situation like I going embrace moment try cool That special
Groundskeepers Atlantic League stand There movement pitcher mound season common sense prevails anytime soon
With strikeout rate rising every season since 2006 Major League Baseball searching way stimulate action field The independent Atlantic League testing ground experimental playing rule The radical proposal scheduled take effect midseason distance pitching rubber home plate moved back two foot 62 foot 6 inch
On Wednesday Atlantic League announced change would delayed second half 2020 season another change use radar tracking technology help umpire call ball strike would introduced gradually season opening day late April
Given fragile nature pitcher arm moving back mound first time since 1893 would seem invite even injury risk The change could also discourage pitcher joining Atlantic League possible injury distance affiliated ball athlete aspire remains 606
Any pitcher significant major league time I think would apprehensive try make change stage career said agent Tom OConnell whose client Jon Niese signed Long Island Ducks Wednesday Thankfully going make decision But I would concerned next year Im former major league player thats trying make comeback concerned
Niese 32 pitched major 2008 2016 missing last two season recovering knee surgery He one two member Mets 2015 World Series team sign Ducks season outfielder Kirk Nieuwenhuis

Parents dont understand boy emotional girl Boys still want break cry society doesnt promote okay I think harder man parent time thats I faced pressure man Parents need find way cope fact man much le important happiness child They express way choose
Joseph Foglietta Danvers MA
Society many stereotype strongest stereotype race gender Society stereotype first two gender although LGBTQIA people gaining acceptance society time absolutely acceptance people The male stereotype male strong tough play sport multiple slightly violent yet charming handsome society accept ugly people either In day age male stereotyped enjoy video game well female allowed stereotype society If male want anything within stereotype something listed stereotype severely punished society way social isolation social exclusion This hard unique society unless popular society push pretend like arent even carry like normal It hard anyone gender race religion ethnicity uphold societal norm strict severe punishment
Jason S Philadelphia PA Masterman
I feel like hardest thing boy dealing people old fashion view stereotype In best case scenario would mean someone making positive assumption Unfortunately often end giving people negative false assumption I also see among younger people see I trait stereotypical boy assume I therefore stereotypical boy While I stereotypical boy thing I annoyed people assumption I stereotypical boy thing
Stereotypes dark dangerous thing people better worse like robot Every person different everyone else least one way make impossible find mean human Stereotypes failed attempt finding mean often end offending people All stereotype people trying create describes everyone failing diverse human nature
Samuel Hamilton Masterman

When I first read title I hesitant write topic I hesitant share opinion matter often time I find opinion valued lesser privilege I find one difficult thing white male America often told opinion matter We speak controversial topic without first accepting sort fault blame I understand great privilege I white male I get I never know others go daily But I try I try understanding try put position support wherever necessary However I constantly feel support welcome I It discouraging feel shunned people share political social view way I present I know I never able change I appearance defines I understanding caring want help others It seems unfair I socially punished thing done generation ago people I connection gender color skin I hate even speak I fear I running risk sounding ignorant I want I find frustrating sexism ignored done men
Ezra Lombardi
Embracing positive aspect masculinity
I feel many tradeoff man The social norm man almost every culture protector provider Men one conscripted military time crisis also expected work support family These responsibility associated manhood part expense benefit men
Despite thing I greatly appreciate boyhood later manhood thing call responsibility appeal I would feel proud father husband working man family I would also glad serve military country I enjoy people consider roughandtumble guy activity So personal perspective thing may consider derogatory stereotype thing I embrace part identity guy
Andrei Mistreanu Hoggard High School Wilmington NC
Since beginning time masculinity part society expected men They protector fighter risked life save family So questioning masculinity Isnt something cant change men deal struggle everyone go
Every human earth go trouble whether money friend family Both male female deal social structure life never escape Men want told people whether theyre feminine masculine They also shouldnt scrutinized man naturally testosterone act fight driving aggressively By saying anyone wont act naturally like saying people wont sad happy jealous
If men stop men world would ruined We men woman reason role society crucial By saying one change act like counterintuitive
The Romans didnt take Gaul Germania talking way We sometimes need force strength despite common belief Were going another war someday well need strongminded people fight

The Tampa Bay Lightning almost unstoppable season racing 62 win 82 game best point total since NHLs current system began 2006
The Lightning scored 103 goal surrendered powered Steven Stamkoss 45 Other star deep team Nikita Kucherov led league point 128 assist 87 Andrei Vasilevskiy rock goal
Its one best Ive ever played said Stamkos 11year veteran asked evaluate team January I concern u taking foot gas
But thats exactly happened The Lightning swept bestofseven series Columbus Blue Jackets even close Tampa Bay outscored 198 four game Stamkos Kucherov held pointless heading Tuesdays series finale slight reawakening star nearly enough stave 73 defeat ended season
There case made Lightning biggest playoff underachiever sport history While big playoff bust team good ever performed badly
Winning Presidents Trophy league best regular season record hardly guarantee playoff success Six time since trophy introduced 1986 team lost first round
But team least game series The worst bust 2012 Canucks lost opening series four game one But 111 point dominant Tampa Bay 128 year And win Game 4 series Los Angeles Kings went win Stanley Cup
Going back 1938 Bruins 1929 Canadiens failed win playoff game best record But bestoffive series team got bye technically lose first round And lost three game single goal
Several NBA team recent year lost first playoff series despite recorded best regularseason record But least two game series The egregious failure probably belongs 2007 Dallas Mavericks whose sterling 6715 record behind Dirk Nowitzki Josh Howard Jason Terry tarnished fourgamestotwo loss eighthseeded Warriors
The 2004 Los Angeles Sparks WNBA team season best record lose first round dropping 21 series Sacramento Monarchs
Baseball started multiround playoff system 1969 The first team league best record get swept first round 1980 Yankees 10359 lost Royals The Angels 2014 9864 also swept Royals fivegame series
But though team fine regular season approach dominance Lightning season The 2001 Mariners 11646 1906 Cubs 11636 would considered big postseason disappointment But Mariners made one playoff round losing Yankees Cubs playing era World Series entire postseason lost four game two
The NFL course different animal playoff consist singleelimination game The undefeated 2007 Patriots remembered losing Giants Super Bowl two playoff game first The worst loss first hurdle belongs 2011 Packers 151 lost 97 Giants 3720
Only two top seed lost first round NCAA tournament In 1998 Stanford woman team 215 seeded No 1 region lost No 16 Harvard Last season Virginia men matched ignominious feat lost Maryland Baltimore County
That Virginia team No 1 country 312 season Though one game defeat probably closest flameout Lightning endured
And Virginia went win title next year possible sign hope Lightning Tuesday night season ended disaster
An earlier version article misstated number point Nikita Kucherov regular season It 128 120

THE STONE
A commonplace modern ritual gave deeper connection today Athenians
By Simon Critchley
Mr Critchley philosophy professor author
ATHENS It time I told I really past month It hasnt visit archaeological site meditation contemporary relevance antiquity Today Id like put ancient history hold moment move past right present
It might objected I writing series postcard perhaps lot local color historical background nonetheless kind highend philosophical tourism famous Athenian location Perhaps cant avoided I foreigner temporary resident And city monument beauty historical grandeur exert pull like virtually others But perhaps better way connecting ordinary Athenians habit routine Maybe I could get closer life vast modern Agora metropolis common passion A passion soccer And site could ordinary pub
I lifelong fan Liverpool Football Club spend much time I care confess watching game reading soccer listening podcasts watching endless YouTube clip highlight news conference often rather tedious match analysis I talk poor soul I find team although I prefer mine Yet much constant amazement exist people world care beautiful game
Liverpool playing day I arrived Athens early January I urgently needed find watch live game TV apartment pretty basic On morning match day I dipped internet discovered promisinglooking Facebook page The PanHellenic Liverpool Friends Club I sent message hope expectation
Three minute later I got reply Good morning m8 You meet u Wee Dram pub It Scottish pub Ask John
I got early asked John It like meeting longlost friend John Skotidas founded official Liverpool supporter club 1995 running ever since good deal organizational skill It 1100 member Liverpool popular English team Greece Ive gotten know John quite well time I He aircraft engineer Greek Air Force 27 year retiring age 46 pursue passion watching talking soccer John even YouTube channel He became Liverpool fan seeing Beatles TV kid late 1960s He liked name Liverpool It sounded good When 10 year old watched play first time Newcastle United FA Cup final 1974 decided support He fan ever since
I also met number people bar first day Scotty Kris Spiros promotes Bollywood movie Greece apparently pretty popular bunch Greek fan I watched first game Jan 12 Liverpool versus Brighton It edgy match confident defensive display u 10 onenil
Since Ive watched awful lot game Wee Dram developed ritual sort I talked fair bit nature ritual series whether processional pomp City Dionysia Divine Liturgy Mount Athos Greater Mysteries Eleusis Watching soccer undoubtedly lesser mystery humble humdrum set ritual action also meaning And every fan ritual superstition
Before leaving apartment I carefully select Liverpool shirt track suit scarf depending weather I always look teensy bit ridiculous walk Syntagma Constitution Square I descend underworld subway system take four stop Panormou station buy piece spanakopita sumptuous spinach pie bakery walk slowly uphill eating get Wee Dram push open door scan room seat look John Hes always sitting spot superstition told next big TV head looking phone Although I always try get early place usually packed John seems secret supply stool whip regular come late place crammed fan
John give nod say word seat open I shake hand everyone ask head bar buy pint Murphys dont sell Guinness sit check WhatsApp connection son Edward London We exchange couple short message like Im position You discus team lineup usually wonder German coach Juergen Klopp included left player particularly like The WiFi tends keep dropping occasion much dashing street
The Wee Dram owned Ross incidentally used play Scottish national basketball team I didnt know one support Hearts Midlothian To The pub two main area glasswalled central room buy drink younger lad tend gather standing together small group often wearing Liverpool shirt larger outside area older fan sitting standing I prefer sit least something really exciting happens I stand retreat backward door pub I dont block anyones view For reason completely escape I often crouch arm right angle fist softly clenched Its almost attitude prayer
Theres large wooden central rectangular table bench hardcore fan sit John pole position top left Most smoking Athens great place pick passive smoking habit Smoking banned course Greeks tend want drinking beer coffee betting online phone Just behind central table another smaller table four five seat marked reserved although turn table reserved This I sit usually familiar face We talk one another much broken English fragmentary Greek great detail quality particular player tactic formation strength opposition Although dont really know one another well immense feeling familiarity affection trust
For nonfan hard explain detailed discussion extraordinary level knowledge ordinary fan posse Although might sound stupid amazing rational intelligence soccer talk bolstered common passion team love
The team emerge I sit straight usual fluff TV commercial dumb graphic kickoff We clap whistle blow enter shared strangely meditative flow game Things get really quiet There always odd experience tension watching game group fellow fan waiting team score least shot engage compelling passage play The TV Wee Dram useless speaker real strain catch Greek commentary Not really understanding word I listen eagerly name almost magical aura Van Dijk Robertson Sadio Mane Milner AlexanderArnold
Of course lot complaint misplaced pas especially star forward player Mohammed Salah shoot miss happening lot late The frequently heard word bar malakas Lets say word wide range semantic connotation many connected sin onanism There visceral connection soccer swearing I disgustingly foulmouthed watching Liverpool play I proud fact often try swallow vowel first consonant bad word spilled lip
When score place explodes Skintight anxiety suddenly release ecstasy Everyone leap foot wild scene joy hugging loud cry I highfive everyone around table often inaccurately I dont know I Its style But I started habit first match January somehow feel obliged continue expect Its little awkward
When opposing team score absolute silence bar Not word And barely reaction The mood shift entirely one speaks least 10 second Malakas
My three month Athens tense time Liverpool fan A sixpoint January lead English Premier League whittled away relentlessness main opponent reigning champion Manchester City fact drew number game Weve lost flair flow attacking rhythm But still fighting match match grinding victory often lastminute goal A nerveshredding experience
Today March 31 absolutely vital game I arrive early Wee Dram 45 minute kickoff around 545 pm There lot banter beer drunk usual server slide crowd setting pizza always shared Liverpool playing Tottenham Hotspur son Edward Anfield Road stadium mate Ben watching live Edward large part reason fate Liverpool Football Club season English Premier League matter much I deviously programmed childhood year support Liverpool better knowledgeable fan I But never seen Liverpool win league 29 year since last happened Liverpool 13 time first 30 year planet Earth But history feel ancient Athens
Spurs fine team Some best friend Spurs fan They didnt deserve lose But obligingly thanks goalkeeping blunder World Cupwinning French captain Hugo Lloris cheeky header sinuous Salah ricocheted net shin Toby Alderweireld 90th minute match Call luck like I choose call destiny
It hard describe feeling sheer unconfined joy team win Everything right world mind free concern distance gnawing introspection Here Wee Dram genuine feeling warmth solidarity among fan Despite linguistic limitation understand one another well team common And 300 official Liverpool supporter club around world countless million watching whatever way After Spurs game Ross played Liverpool anthem Youll Never Walk Alone Gerry Pacemakers everyone sang along bellowing tune top voice It really something
I realize ritual pretty stupid shallow far sentimental moment I feel real sense disinhibited belonging people feel
After song climaxed final chorus faded I finished beer looked John say goodbye But hed already left
Will win league Probably Manchester City better football team But today I dont much walk glide hill subway station texting Edward reading early match report I pick loaf bread bakery head back center city Life good
Athens Pieces eightpart philosophical tour ancient city The entire series found
