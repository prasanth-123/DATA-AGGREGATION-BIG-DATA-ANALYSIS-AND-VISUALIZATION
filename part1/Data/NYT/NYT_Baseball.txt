Theres much actionable feedback today ever dont let player go path long path thats going work long term big league Luhnow said

Before relied scout coach say Well need make adjustment trust Ive seen youre going work next level need change something Luhnow said Now actually show video show number say This youre Ill show doesnt work next level show work let work changing modifying youre
That definition lead higher success rate development Lets say 5 percent player get developed big leaguers go 7 percent Thats massive difference havent increased capacity weve done increase throughput So success rate good player probably result abundance oversupply Obviously doesnt affect Harper Machado option
Other team noticed Astros success Two Luhnows assistant become general manager elsewhere Baltimores Elias Milwaukee Brewers David Stearns several former Astros coach received promotion team including Alex Cora managed Boston Red Sox World Series title last fall
The thing happened Los Angeles Dodgers two National League pennant row knack progressive method Their president baseball operation Andrew Friedman said got 39 request last fall team wanting interview Dodgers personnel
The past two offseasons Ive spent first four six week like HR director Friedman said
When Dodgers lost hitting coach Turner Ward Cincinnati Reds replaced Robert Van Scoyoc 32 private hitting instructor never played professionally helped otherwise ordinary hitter like JD Martinez Chris Taylor develop star Unlocking hitting secret Friedman said remains largely untapped field
Since Ive sitting advance meeting closer prep nothing changed offensive side 12 13 year said whereas runprevention side everything changed
While run per game fluctuated decade strikeout ultimate way fool overpower hitter increased every season since 2006 This month league union finally gave trend legislated change
With end sight procession polished power arm agreed expand size active roster next season 26 virtually assuring record 1379 player season last long

The best way understand Mike Trout outfielder baseball Los Angeles Angels Tuesday reportedly agreed richest contract North American sport perfect reflection sport
Little known many Americans including sport fan Trout 27 best player game frequently mocked fading form entertainment primarily regional audience
Baseball often dismissed far le enticing NFL believed bring 14 billion annually even health safety issue Baseball also called le dynamic NBA even though 2 billion le revenue MLB last year
So Trouts 12year 430 million contract revealed prompted obvious question How could sport struggling attract new generation fan facing potentially bruising labor fight player two year afford yet another ninefigure contract
News Trouts deal came three week outfielder Bryce Harper accepted 13year 330 million contract Phillies month infielder Manny Machado got 10year 300 million deal San Diego Padres
A comparison Major League Baseball player signed contract least 100 million
The answer mechanic collective bargaining agreement player owner anything might constitute referendum game popularity There several dynamic work sport huge wealth still flow best best le money left socalled middle class despite continuing growth baseball revenue
Owners seems figured keep cost using younger player cheaper veteran thus freeing cash occasional megadeal Players like Trout Harper Machado benefit others forced accept le
In past team valuing player differently said James Paxton starting pitcher Yankees For long time system fine Now team changed way theyre valuing player especially older player kind broken system forcing u take look
In study yet published JC Bradbury economics professor Kennesaw State University calculated baseball revenue rose average rate 66 percent 2003 2015 player salary rose average rate 44 percent
Major League Baseball revenue reached 103 billion last year The source include evermore money guaranteed source like multibilliondollar medium deal entire sport lucrative medium contract many local level Less important ticket sale generally fluctuate win loss
With shift valuation player average salary went 2018 first time 14 year little 4 million according player association It fourth time last 50 year average gone
Dan Halem deputy commissioner MLB said evidence team trying win painted different picture baseball economics
Salaries gone average 53 percent year since 2012 keeping pace baseball revenue growth time said pay may slightly flat 2018 one year make trend He also said last decade player received consistent percentage game revenue 52 57 percent
In marketbased system depending upon year club valuing player said Halem certain player better others
Yet word like collusion strike third rail sport especially ruinous strike 19941995 regularly uttered player agent despite huge contract
Focusing giant deal miss bigger picture according Jeff Borris longtime baseball agent represented star like Barry Bonds general counsel Ballengee Group sport representation agency
Contracts like Trouts Harpers aberration Borris said The focus thing like isnt Dallas Keuchel signed contract Gio Gonzalez signed Those area concern
Keuchel twotime AllStar starting pitcher Houston Astros remained unsigned one week opening day Gonzalez solid durable starting pitcher signed minorleague deal Yankees
I think owner manipulating system advantage Borris said
For decade baseball player represented widely considered strongest union professional sport As result baseball limit salary though luxury tax penalizes team payroll rise 206 million function de facto cap
The problem least articulated player team reward superstar longer feel compelled spend win believe already piece place compete championship
Why interest player help team win particularly get last two week spring training Tony Clark executive director player association said Trout deal reached
Despite baseball strong union certain provision kept salary rising decade turned norm hard fast rule
Baseball player become free agent accrue six year service time They generally paid league minimum first three season next three receive higher salary negotiation arbitration This lead odd situation like Trouts voted American League valuable player third full season earning 1 million
This used acceptable player made back end career There infamous albatross contract given veteran like 125 million extension signed Ryan Howard 2010 time veteran player paid fair wage slightly overpaid well 30 sometimes 40
Its coincidence Trout Harper Machado got megadeals age 27 younger But circumstance older player like Gonzalez Keuchel demonstrate team working assumption veteran ability likely decline soon salary peak make sense use younger player fill roster lower cost risk even chance make playoff also reduced
I dont think thought team sudden going stop competing degree said Adam Ottavino Yankees pitcher A lot thing changed really fast

With 3089 hit major 1278 Japan believe Suzuki surpassed Pete Rose It complicated
By Benjamin Hoffman
How many hit Ichiro Suzuki It seems like simple question answer like everything Suzukis world simple
Some number clear After starting season 0 5 Suzuki announced retirement Thursday leaving 3089 hit across part 19 major league season In Japan began career 1278 hit nine season
Those total ranked 23rd major 21 hit behind Dave Winfield seven ahead Albert Pujols 95th Japan But become common simply combine total crediting 4367 career hit thus pushing past Pete Rose baseball hit king
That thing get murky Its widely understood Nippon Professional Baseball Suzuki starred Orix BlueWave produce toptier major league talent league level MLB So simply add hit free adjustment context could seen akin including player minor league statistic
Once allowing course fact way compare quality various minor international league across era degree certainty Suzuki fall behind Rose edging Ty Cobb second place
With Suzuki falling short either way easier view hit total separately without trying find way combine Rose remains hit king especially perspective people United States Similarly Barry Bonds considered home run champion 762 despite Sadaharu Oh hitting 868 Japan 22season career ended 1980
Still mean Suzuki lesser hitter Rose A 311 hitter major 353 hitter Japan Suzuki perhaps greatest spray hitter history regardless league He hit little power despite known prodigious blast batting practice drew relatively walk Yet despite spending nine year pro career different league retire sixthmost single major league history outdistanced master art like Rod Carew Tony Gwynn
In addition line drive Suzuki topnotch defender aboveaverage base stealer giving skill set stick among peer By similarity score statistic developed statistician Bill James sort player statistically similar adjustment made position Carews career closest one Suzukis 8498 point possible 1000 But list 10 player similar Suzuki includes Max Carey Doc Cramer Harry Hooper In six 10 made debut 1930 The player last 30 year show list Kenny Lofton Gwynn
Off field Suzuki combination personality insistence interpreter provide literal translation Japanese English long known delivering spectacular quotation He disappoint asked Sports Illustrated 2002 describe career instant fame upon joining Mariners 2001
Im unique said Im rare kind player
His distinctive achievement secured year almost certainly become first player inducted hall fame Japan United States
He need baseball hit king He likely need last several season major secured spot hall And even ignoring time Japan entirely retires 10time AllStar 10time Gold Glove winner twotime batting champion onetime winner Most Valuable Player Award He owns record hit single season legend powerful throwing arm carry long reputation batting exploit
He may surpassed Rose hit make hall fame two country seems perfectly encapsulate player unique distinction superstar two league feat capped perfectly final game professional coming Japan
Adding league accurate manner may difficult declaring rare use Suzukis word remarkably easy

SURPRISE Ariz After Kansas City Royals departed spring training road game last month general manager Dayton Moore stayed behind team training complex watch prospect back field It decade ago longtime coach Bill Fischer called excitedly share vision
Fish said I saw Latin version Johnny Bench Moore said sitting dugout smiling memory I said Whos He said Salvador Perez Fish recognized right away
Bench may greatest catcher ever Perez catcher make least six AllStar team winning five Gold Gloves World Series Most Valuable Player Award
He rare modern specie highimpact offensive catcher play lot game
As recently 2007 28 player appeared least 95 game catcher Last season number dwindled 15 fewest since major expanded 30 team 1998 Perez sixth season row streak end 2019 At moment Moore spoke Perez Los Angeles undergo Tommy John surgery cost season
Its big blow morale organization Salvys energygiver Moore said The fan adore show watch play regardless standing
Without Perez hit 27 homer last two season catcher offensive production could slip season In 2018 major league catcher produced 233 batting average 678 onbase plus slugging percentage lowest figure 30team era
Its physically demanding position thats true year said Matt Klentak general manager Philadelphia Phillies On top shift throughout league recent year way catcher defense evaluated prioritizing catcher framing The impact framing game real case team willing trade offense exchange better receiving skill
Catchers hit still valued evidenced Phillies trade Miami Marlins J T Realmuto game best offensive catcher But Boston Red Sox showed last season slugger behind plate always necessary They World Series despite 194 average 533 OPS catcher worst mark champion liveball era
We look catcher defensive position said Dave Dombrowski Bostons president baseball operation And defensive efficiency bring u thing measure framing throwing guy time second base handling staff following game plan want put high priority
And job getting challenging Teams use pitcher per season ever fastball velocity risen recent year pitcher also throwing greater percentage breaking ball That one factor explaining wild pitch passed ball rise
More important though emphasis framing getting borderline pitch called strike When catcher try present pitch corner strike try keep glove strike zone Catching pitch tip webbing pocket naturally lead pitch clip edge mitt roll away
It may demanding position sport Moore said There good NFL quarterback complete major league catcher standard raised
Those standard changing reflected Red Sox satisfied catcher Blake Swihart Christian Vasquez brought back despite weak bat Boston catcher excelled defense ranking third major framing according Baseball Prospectus The two team National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers first place Arizona Diamondbacks
It coincidence one Arizonas catcher last season Jeff Mathis attracted attention team ranked worst framing Texas Rangers Mathis hit 200 198 average across 14 season exceptional defensive skill earned twoyear 625 million deal Rangers
That modest deal industry standard richest one Mathis turn 36 month ever signed He might little market appeal anymore today method measuring defense
Ive always taken lot pride defensive side game Mathis said Obviously Id love contribute lot offensively I think I But acknowledge defense way last year something Ive definitely benefited definitely thankful
Jon Daniels Rangers president baseball operation said team determined start offseason target defensiveoriented catcher The Rangers entering final season outdoor Globe Life Park hitter paradise plan integrate young pitcher onto roster move indoor ballpark 2020
Besides Mathis Rangers considered Martin Maldonado lingered market eventually signed Royals Perezs replacement 25 million Maldonado meager 616 OPS Los Angeles Angels last season still appealed Houston Astros traded July started six eight playoff game
The previous October Brian McCann caught every inning Astros victory Game 7 World Series The 35yearold McCann second active list game caught behind St Louis Cardinals Yadier Molina slumped 212 average last season signed one year 2 million original team Atlanta Braves
Jeff Luhnow Astros general manager former Cardinals executive spoke wistfully recently day Yadi Molina He could bring say day see successor
Im sure guy like future I dont know developing catcher much Luhnow said Of position baseball thats probably thinnest
This may simply cycle Baseball America ranked seven catcher among top 100 prospect season since 2012 Then crop seven year ago Travis dArnaud Yasmani Grandal Devin Mesoraco Jesus Montero Wilin Rosario Gary Sanchez Swihart yielded many star
Neal Huntington Pittsburgh Pirates general manager said rise yearround amateur baseball could burning catching prospect relentless physical demand said help developing hitter If catching prospect show promising bat added talent evaluator may want change position Bryce Harper Phillies new 330 million outfielder catcher amateur
The guy may midrange defender swing bat little bit may thinking shifting behind home plate want bat play weve become strict receiving analytics almost unforgiving case Huntington said
So weve shifted pendulum way defensive side recognize value brings Theres also value guy receive hit guy who exceptional receiver get benefit doubt every single time weve able quantify So guy used kind fade away hanging around longer
Mathis veteran catcher receive multiyear deal free agency Kurt Suzuki 35 got twoyear 10 million contract November Washington Nationals stop Ten day later traded Yan Gomes AllStar catcher Cleveland last season
Suzuki caught 141 game Oakland 2008 first full season major said happy share role The analytics wave identifies value catcher defense also make job demanding volume information process game
It used DVD Suzuki said Youd watch video go This going get Now youve got heat map velocity youre like Wow brain cram Its lot studying lot stress strain brain To mental rest awesome

Whenever Major League Baseball open season Japan count Oakland Athletics show The regular season start Tokyo Dome fifth time Wednesday third time row As
They never main draw love
Its cool baseball big part culture outfielder Stephen Piscotty said Mesa Ariz day As left spring training I cant wait I fired I heard going
The As essentially Seattle Mariners Ichiro Suzuki need opponent The Mariners abruptly ended Suzukis season last May 15 lackluster game active Wednesday Thursday game start 535 Eastern hoping add career hit total 4367 major Japan
Oakland meanwhile hoping stage revival 2012 visit began improbable run division title threeyear playoff streak The As faced Seattle begin season opened Boston Red Sox Tokyo 2008
It get even closer Manager Bob Melvin said seasonopening trip We new guy year core group thats together came minor league together together All play there value
The As talk lot intangible might seem odd team responsible analytics wave washed across game century But improved 97 win last season 75 2017 hear The path improbable wildcard berth closer Blake Treinen said started selfless attitude
When everybody beautiful thing happens thats happened u last year said I mean nobody even guessed 80 win Nobody guessed 75 probably You stack everything analytics want there place there also place heart
Heart yes Oaklands formula also includes home run stingy relief pitching especially stellar defense Matt Chapman Matt Olson cornerstone corner Olson Gold Glove first base Chapman third base adding Platinum Glove best overall fielder American League
I havent got yet I think present year get take home said Chapman 25 But I dont house going go parent front room probably Theyll probably put Gold Glove Platinum Glove house hopefully come
Last season Chapmans first full year major except onegame injury rehabilitation assignment Olson AL player appear 162 game
Olsons agility long lever 6 foot 5 inch big help Chapman shortstop Marcus Semien A reliable first baseman perhaps important As team ballpark foul territory major throw skip past Olson would typically result two extra base
I cant tell many time saved ontherun play I made I threw line dug Chapman said Hes like 10 foot tall bag hell pick anything go line he afraid sacrifice body Im thankful I probably owe steak dinner I think
Only Yankees Los Angeles Dodgers hit homer last season As bring back top four homerun hitter Khris Davis majorleague leader 48 Olson 29 Piscotty 27 Chapman 24 But added Marco Estrada thin starting rotation Melvin would prefer use opener last fall wildcard loss Yankees
That make essential As prevent run standout defense Chapman set standard
Hes freak athlete start Olson said He get thing I never seen I played Hes consistent he hardworking You find batting practice every day running tired taking ground ball We always say he like dog fun
Chapman attended El Toro High School Lake Forest Calif Nolan Arenado Colorado Rockies perennial NL Gold Glove third baseman two year older Both player shortstop Chapman said closely followed top third basemen like Adrian Beltre Evan Longoria David Wright To Melvin Chapman already belongs class
The arm strength ground cover ground air ballpark air big bullpen dugout Melvin said With shift put shortstop know he going cover whole left side infield want cover whole left side infield
Added Melvin played managed major 25 season I dont know Ive around talented defender probably ever
Suzukis return Mariners active roster command attention opening series course 45 year old baseball treasure two continent But captivating inhisprime talent probably Chapman platinum glove indispensable team

The Boston Red Sox received latest World Series ring Tuesday version fourth last 15 season beauty Encircling facing two row 128 total diamond symbolizing franchise nine overall championship 119 victory 2018 The inscription band subtle TEAM FOR THE AGES
So The Red Sox dominant last October lost three postseason series In first three series season though apiece They lost home opener leaving record 39 Thursday night game Toronto Blue Jays
The easy explanation schedule The Red Sox last team play home season opening road Seattle Mariners Oakland Athletics Arizona Diamondbacks finally staggering back Fenway Park No defending champion ever played first 11 game road
Then rough part schedule always definition creates easier patch later The Red Sox already finished longest road trip season play 13 final 22 game Fenway The Yankees hand play six final 21 game Bronx
By perhaps Tampa Bay Rays run away American League East The Rays Bostons mirror image 12 game 93 record While Tampa Bay starter major leaguebest 177 earned run average game Boston starter major leagueworst 878 ERA
How bad 878 ERA 12 start To put individual context consider seven pitcher ever higher ERA season 12 start One Pittsburgh Pirates Steve Blass 1973 suddenly lost ability throw strike The mysterious condition since known colloquially Steve Blass Disease
The early failure Red Sox rotation slightly le startling woe Blass starred playoff previous fall thrown final pitch World Series year Chris Sale collected final Red Sox Dodger Stadium last October 03 900 ERA confounding start pitcher signed fiveyear 145 million contract extension last month
Sale 30 actually yet begun deal run 2020 2024 While closed last season scripted moment triumph Red Sox fourrun lead Game 5 squeezed life Dodgers pitched six inning start since AllStar break last July Sale bothered shoulder trouble stretch worked 30⅓ inning final eight start including postseason
The Red Sox satisfied enough condition Sales shoulder give new contract But Sales average fastball velocity dipped 913 mile per hour season according Fangraphs 947 last season He thrown 88 fastball far according MLBcom generated two swinging strike
Im struggling Sale told reporter Tuesdays 75 loss lasted four inning I dont know Ive ever pitched like life
The Red Sox expect worry rotation Their starter made relief cameo last postseason eager contribute title run expertly deployed Manager Alex Cora In spring training Cora limited workload even year eye long game
We want great whole season dont want situation come April theyre great throughout season theyre going Cora said March Every game count obviously March 28 way end regular season want consistent I think understand
With farm system largely depleted trade Red Sox invested heavily starter Sale David Price Rick Porcello Nathan Eovaldi Eduardo Rodriguez combine make 885 million season entire payroll Pittsburgh Pirates Baltimore Orioles Miami Marlins Rays
Yet Red Sox met minimum requirement quality start least six inning three earned run far April 2 Oakland Sale allowed one run six inning one strikeout
There encouraging sign The Red Sox bullpen minus Craig Kimbrel unsigned free agent closer performed well 361 ERA All major position player healthy The starter proven track record
But team repeated World Series champion since 2000 baseball began testing performanceenhancing drug The toll three postseason round without access shortcut physical recovery appears real
For inspiration Red Sox could look another Boston team recovered even worse beginning win championship The 1914 Boston Braves started 316 yet romped pennant upended Philadelphia As win World Series
Of course history know team Miracle Braves might take another miracle Red Sox stage encore team age

This always logical blueprint Mike Trout greatest least complicated player baseball Trout would sell short financially also would draw process determining future He Los Angeles Angels would wait Bryce Harper set contract record free agency make deal would break
That happened apparently Trout Angels finalizing 10year 360 million contract extension optouts deal bring Angels total commitment nearly 430 million Trout next 12 season 2030
The agreement first reported ESPN expected formalized soon according two people briefed authorized comment publicly It fourth megadeal reached spring training following Nolan Arenado eight year 260 million Colorado Rockies Manny Machado 10 year 300 million San Diego Padres Bryce Harper 13 year 330 million Philadelphia Phillies
Those contract little quell angst player association relatively subdued state overall free agent market The union become suspicious ownership moved camp visit outside clubhouse spring training fear possible surveillance inside team facility The union dismayed lackluster bidding sort midlevel free agent recently generated much interest open market
What weve seen last couple year havent seen Tony Clark union executive director said Sunday citing climate dont think sustainable industry whole
The deal Arenado Machado Harper though showed team still place premium elite talent Trout 27 best best The similar player history age according Baseball Reference Hall Famers Frank Robinson Ken Griffey Jr Mickey Mantle Trout two American League Most Valuable Player Awards runnerup four time He 307 career average major active leader onbase plus slugging percentage 990
Trouts contract set expire 2020 season Harper publicly pushed Trout eventually join Philadelphia Trout attends Eagles game offseason traveling nearby hometown Millville NJ But Angels emphasized Trout benefit keeping work home life separate promoted idea oneteam icon place thrived
In interview month Angels training camp Tempe Ariz Trout seemed content team new manager Brad Ausmus offseason addition
Its like whole new start Trout said I think biggest thing injury Weve got stay healthy top bottom stay field see go The chemistry great lot new face lot new coach meeting lot new people Everybodys great far
The Angels reached playoff Trout swept Kansas City 2014 division series But team far hopeless 584550 record Trouts seven full season farm system rank No 6 according Baseball Prospectus Their stadium lease Anaheim run 2020 could theory open new ballpark Trout retires
A comparison Major League Baseball player signed contract least 100 million
Since wildly overpaying Albert Pujols Josh Hamilton early decade Angels added highimpact player like shortstop Andrelton Simmons outfielder Justin Upton twoway star Shohei Ohtani General Manager Billy Eppler signed catcher Jonathan Lucroy pitcher Cody Allen Trevor Cahill Matt Harvey oneyear deal winter steadily modernized way Angels use technology
Still Houston Astros dominant team AL West Trout could used clout publicly demand organization close gap He never said 2017 interview Anaheim belief Eppler lieutenant
Theyre good job trying put player right spot Trout said Youve got trust Theres much
Had Trout played deal noise around future would intensified surely unappealing prospect player never court controversy Yet Trout exactly withdrawn He readily accessible reporter active benign presence social medium might lead league signing autograph
Trout endorsement deal spend much time promoting personal brand source frustration Major League Baseball would rather best player showed interest marketing To Trout though never made much sense
Trout always seemed recognize good little incentive disrupt life He dominant field respected comfortable direction franchise happy Southern California Southern New Jersey extremely well paid Who could ask
If Mike Trout agent Craig Landis asked would really wake morning say Ive got start changing thing
It rhetorical question course Trout answered resounding You blame surprised

There proclamation Aaron Boone start Yankees season guarantee March glory October That baseball work Boone know bone The Boone family grandfather Ray father Bob brother Aaron Bret played 58 distinguished season major two World Series
One reason sign want win championship everyone room expectation rightfully I think one team potential Boone Yankees manager said batting practice Thursdays season opener Bronx But long way So much thats intent kind also get lost day lost grind
The Yankees ground lowly Baltimore Orioles submission 72 sunsplashed stressfree afternoon They got run needed Luke Voits threerun homer first inning Mariano Rivera still chatting reporter ceremonial first pitch
Rivera newly minted unanimous Hall Famer five World Series ring Yankees last 2009 He different perspective Boones applied oldstyle Yankees urgency Boones team
Its amazing 10 year time Rivera said Its time get No 28 I believe team Ive seen guy talent enough win The question hungry enough win And I believe
For team decade without championship hardly noteworthy The Orioles returned World Series since winning third title 1983 That first 13 year team dominated much stretch haze angst old Memorial Stadium
Well New York said Jim Palmer Hall Famer pitched Orioles one broadcaster We never Yankees What 28 world champion 27
They 27 every Yankees fan know But Boston four last 15 season Yankees one
Lets give credit Red Sox Palmer said But funny Yankees never bottomed like Red Sox They finished last couple time I mean got really bad
So one brutal Boston summer allowed take impact hitter Andrew Benintendi seventh overall pick 2015 draft The Yankees losing record since 1992 drafted Derek Jeter sixth
Last year 100win season ended division series loss home Red Sox outspent every team romped October In way Yankees path major elite even impressive Bostons rebuilt fly without embarrassment finishing last Red Sox 2012 2014 2015
But another season without championship would represent Yankees longest drought since 18year stretch preceded victory 1996 The Aaron Judge Yankees twice fallen short playoff
Having last couple season theyve lot success ended disappointing way I think thats added hunger Boone said And I like intent hunger guy I feel like showing day day right
They showed style victory Thursday The Yankees 234 hitter Judge Giancarlo Stanton Voit reached base 11 time 14 try often walk hit pitch
A lot guy want come gate swinging trying get first hit way said Voit came twice walk Stanton For control zone way really impressive
The Orioles far major worst team last season 47115 Yankees 12 19 meeting That good great Red Sox pummeled Orioles going 163 Even Toronto Blue Jays 145 better Baltimore Yankees
Asked importance game weak team American League could several Judge careful praise Orioles But added telling revelation
Thats big thing I think last year lot time team 500 didnt well said So thats priority spring training going Just go try dominate every single pitch every single team
That secret best team recent major league history 1998 Yankees They never took game That season went 211 overmatched Devil Rays Royals 81 Expos Marlins Phillies worst interleague rival
So long schedule unfolds keep track showcase game Red Sox Houston Astros highflying hopeful Queens unbeaten unscoredon Mets If Yankees play every game every team relentless approach Thursday might fulfill Riveras prophecy
New year new challenge new beginning new beginning great hope Rivera said It good year 2019 Good thing happen 2019

So anyway Preacher article got 2000 sometime later I talked Preach said Carl know I ruined chance Hall Fame admitting I threw spitter youre one advised And I said Well Preacher I saw pitch pitcher pitcher You could without spitter
Maybe maybe While Erskine believed Roe man didnt In confession Roe said turned pitch slumping 415 Pirates 1947 Reviving spitter practiced Harry Brecheen Cardinals farmhand last chance He made becoming regular AllStar though quite Cooperstown candidate Dodgers Cheating made sense
Why shouldnt I Roe told Dick Young Sports Illustrated article I I decided get pitch If I get caught I told theyll kick If I dont Im anyway I lose
He didnt lose often Roe much 715 winning percentage seven season Brooklyn guessed spitter earned 100000 On bench inning Roe would pop stick BeechNut gum mouth announce Im going get new batch curveballs In game hed spit meaty part thumb pretending wipe brow Then hitching belt hed subtly wipe index middle finger saliva Two wet finger top dry thumb underneath Roe ready He compared squeezing peach pit watermelon seed fingertip
The idea get part grip wet dry said When ball leaf hand slip wet finger cling tinylike dry part thumb The ball jump account If good un drop like dead duck cross plate
Roes confession confirmed reputation As Stan Musial wrote decade later Id always firstpitch hitting Roe two strike hed usually load I hated get shower Anticipation spitter helped Roe knew destroy evidence He never caught act
The umpire would call ball Preacher would stomp around look hand like Uhoh probably got time Erskine say instead tossing ball hed roll umpire ground
Like steroid user decade later Roe stayed ahead cop thrived But pang regret Erskine least going public bursting cloud mystery showed knew done The specter dark art would indeed follow Roe grave died 2008 word spitball appeared headline New York Times obituary
After two chaotic decade spitball banned 1920 year country went dry Prohibition The rule simply turned mound speakeasy many pitcher going undercover get slippery edge predecessor
The physic behind spitball simple enough When ball slide wet finger loses backspin therefore rotates le something like knuckleball rotate forkball tumbling final plunge
Defacing surface ball produce kind effect added movement opposite side scuff This also date game early day Imagine baseball looked like early 20th century
Wed play whole game one ball stayed park Wahoo Sam Crawford Hall Famer played 1899 1917 say The Glory Their Times book Lawrence S Ritter
Lopsided black full tobacco licorice stain Crawford continues The pitcher used way back
Even possibility scuffing give pitcher edge These word come Chet Brewer star Kansas City Monarchs Negro National League late 1920s sound timeless
A cut ball I got credit told John Holway book Black Diamonds If I picked rough one I didnt throw game I didnt exactly put cut I could pitch
Scuffing charge never dogged Mike Mussina Hall Fame righthander Orioles Yankees 1991 2008 But like smart pitcher would never reject ball came mark This Mussinas order every catcher If ball scrape ground never volunteer umpire
Say guy hit ground ball short throw back first base soon I grab ball Im running thumb Mussina say He holding ball referring white area within horseshoe Do I sinker ball And I find one I think pretty good I flip side see scuffed wrong side
By mean opposite side horseshoe area scuffed theyll counteract advantage If there scuff seam narrow sweet spot creates fourseam sinker pitch spin like straight fastball veers away direction opposite scuff
A common lament among retired pitcher many ball thrown play To underscore lack craftsmanship mound
Ive literally seen teammate there scuff ball get rid say Jamie Moyer 269 game career ended 2012 year turned 50 Theyll say Oh funny stuff go Wait minute funny stuff benefit
Hitters conditioned ask umpire discard ball skip Umpires catcher know catcher tend almost reflexive response They spear ball dirt transfer quickly throwing hand hold ump keep reject
Of course fielder still try create scuff Catchers may deliberately shorthop throw inning outfielder may routine throw infield But time changed
When I played ball hit dirt still play say Chili Davis Mets hitting coach played 1981 1999 Todays game catcher throw ball second short hop ball get blocked dirt ball game Its automatic
Pitchers also seek way look natural applying moisture tackiness finger One former player broadcaster reached team ball bag pulled canister colorless TufSkin spray help secure athletic tape With one spritz TufSkin arm I invisible island instant tackiness finger
Thats also pitcher like putting clear BullFrog sunscreen arm Grab rosin bag aimlessly touch BullFrog spot youll enough stickiness help guide pitch One catcher say seen pitcher leave dugout inning wrap finger around ball coated pine tar leaving enough residue hand get better grip return mound
Next time go game notice surface pitcher touch hand Pitchers fidgety creature constantly tugging swiping scratching cap sleeve skin something Corey Kluber twotime Cy Young Award winner Cleveland grab tongue mound every pitch became legal year ago wipe hand side pant
The way rub ball rub advance Kluber say Theyre rubbed day sit bucket dust stuff get slippery Just get little bit moisture hand least Youve still got wipe obviously get little bit moisture hand ball dry
Kluber matter weather tactic especially handy cold high altitude harder generate moisture
I tell say one 10year veteran could get camera behind dugout Colorado would like mad scientist laboratory people anything find grip
Most player even hitter tend accept practice A pitch instrument destruction hitter would rather pitcher know going accidentally fire cue ball head It fine distinction sure logic Tackiness help command finish pitch thats OK Sandpaper KY Jelly help enhance movement thats
In cold weather Minnesota something grip curveball say Jim Kaat starred Twins 1960s Pitchers year lobbied If hitter use pine tar grip bat better doesnt help em hit farther able use pine tar
Then come back discretion In 2014 Yankees Michael Pineda brazenly smeared pine tar neck chilly night Fenway Park overt Red Sox felt compelled object Pineda got 10game suspension widespread ridicule But generally long pitcher discreet side problem pine tar
Pine tar one thing cheating letter law yes spirit Whatever happened spitball Hall Fame pitch Jack Chesbro Ed Walsh Stan Coveleski Red Faber Burleigh Grimes Gaylord Perry Richie Ashburn hit 1950s always thought pitcher shifty character never trusted
Where scoundrel gone
When I asked Perry 2018 pitcher shall say crafty day short telling answer Well maybe dont need Dan Plesac pitched 1000 game agreed
Youre looking Don Sutton guy sink cut make ball move Plesac say If dont velocity cant pitch anymore How many guy many real power pitcher need scuff ball successful Not many You dont need stuff good
Plesac work MLB Network founded 2009 hub baseball vast everexpanding visual empire Every fan watch game At Bat app Every team bank video screen usually dugout showing every conceivable angle replay analysis Good luck evading sophisticated alarm system baseball history
When there many TV camera hard get away say Jason Giambi played 20 season major You many set eye guy especially see pitch look really abnormal team video analyst rewinds 5000 time OK different Oh went side pant went belt went top hat Then start put together timeline every time he pitched ball thing What last start start And know theyve got right go tell umpire check hat check side pant check inside glove You cant hide anymore
But could What next Preacher Roe Gaylord Perry hiding plain sight diamond near fiendishly fooling viewer video technician ballpark beyond
He could blacktop lot driveway selling secret hed probably keep supply finishing job The sticky sealant might come handy

That depth allows Manager Dave Roberts aggressively exploit matchup advantage offense use starting pitcher extreme caution The Dodgers team used pitcher 180 inning last three season
They tempted season unleash Walker Buehler sparkled last fall onegame playoff Colorado National League West title Game 7 National League Championship Series clincher Milwaukee Dodgers victory World Series shut Red Sox seven inning
Buehler 24 young homegrown starter could make major impact season The lefthander Julio Urias 22 showed October past shoulder trouble cost nearly two season
Theres really pitch limit Walker going see body reacting feel open line communication Roberts said With Julio abbreviated last couple year say clear runway I dont think fair But I know he going impact u year
Buehler veteran Clayton Kershaw taken slowly spring training Dodgers hard tell difference hurt injured They play long game Los Angeles arriving full strength October matter
The Dodgers lost contributor last year team added center fielder AJ Pollock force Arizona healthy reliever Joe Kelly plan use expanded setup role could stretch 90 inning grizzled catcher Russell Martin 338 onbase percentage Toronto last year Martins 194 batting average bother Dodgers Friedman said consistently made hard contact
Martin 36 played five league championship series without ever advancing World Series This could year get luck might leap arm closer Kenley Jansen final
Then Colorado Rockies conceding nothing pursuit first division title They signed Daniel Murphy play first base gave third baseman Nolan Arenado eightyear 260 million contract extension last month The entire team surprised Arenado attending news conference announcing deal

AL Preview How Hard Will It Be Red Sox Repeat Ask Astros
You need quality young player making majorleague minimum prearbitration salary enable go sign biggerdollar player especially market unlimited fund General Manager AJ Preller said We feel weve built talent base enable u get conversation Machado bigname free agent

Its difficult put position ever outfielder Ryan Braun said We could much better team much better regular season thing go right get place Game 7 get World Series home pitcher want mound Game 6 felt great chance Im grateful opportunity easy thing get
The Brewers hope get finding ace two group rookie pitched mostly relief October Corbin Burnes Freddy Peralta Brandon Woodruff They lean heavily strong bullpen slugging lineup includes Most Valuable Player Award winner Christian Yelich new catcher Yasmani Grandal hit 24 home run 815 onbase plus slugging percentage Dodgers last season
The Dodgers benched Grandal postseason struggled defense Game 1 NLCS Milwaukee That diminished Grandals value gave Brewers opportunity oneyear 1825 million contract could steal
Look guy go defensive slump General Manager David Stearns said We focused entirety think contribute team think meaningful Hes good receiver he good framer handle pitching staff well control running game
The St Louis Cardinals went 4128 last season Manager Mike Shildt replaced fired Mike Matheny midJuly It wasnt quite enough lift playoff return year threeyear absence interminable gap regal brand
Its long time I know said John Mozeliak president baseball operation Were aware
In Goldschmidt Marcell Ozuna Matt Carpenter Cardinals three elite run producer go slick defender like center fielder Harrison Bader second baseman Kolten Wong catcher Yadier Molina 36 ninth Gold Glove Jack Flaherty could breakout rotation star Jordan Hicks threw 41 pitch last season hit 103 mile per hour higher form imposing relief duo newcomer Andrew Miller
The Chicago Cubs finally solved Miller Game 7 2016 World Series Cleveland completed comeback first championship since 1908 They returned World Series last season wildcard flameout put clubhouse notice Theo Epstein president baseball operation vowed sweeping change see improvement
Manager Joe Maddon working final year contract surrounded new coach roster still includes half player appeared Cubs World Series The core deserves one chance another title would surprise But given strength division neither would third place
The Cincinnati Reds team major least 90 loss last four season That streak end Reds finally pair solid offense respectable rotation Luis Castillo Anthony DeSclafani Sonny Gray Tanner Roark Alex Wood If AL Central Reds might favorite The NL version much different
Ill tell right best division baseball said Reds reliever Jared Hughes also played Pittsburgh Milwaukee Were always incredibly competitive top bottom The goal win division win World Series vibe coming capable But there complacency NL Central
The Pittsburgh Pirates also dream big five exceptional pitcher starter Jameson Taillon Chris Archer Trevor Williams reliever Felipe Vazquez Keone Kela But middling offense got upgrade right fielder Gregory Polanco spend least first month recovering shoulder surgery
Across Pennsylvania Philadelphia Phillies clear winner offseason meaningless title course reason enough consider East favorite despite going 820 last September spoil promising season
We lot hole fill conclusion said John Middleton Phillies managing partner When look rubble last six week 18 season werent player away good team We bunch player away
General Manager Matt Klentak started acquiring shortstop Jean Segura Seattle part deal Carlos Santana masterstroke allowed Rhys Hoskins move back first base left field Andrew McCutchen play signing free agent Klentak also signed reliever David Robertson traded game best catcher JT Realmuto
It good winter Phillies signed Bryce Harper former Nationals star 13 year 330 million
To clubhouse deflating team division great feeling side starter Jake Arrieta said Not team division scared mean I dont think thats case But definitely appreciate organization signing guy like Harper bringing piece
The Washington Nationals still reach playoff Patrick Corbin joining Max Scherzer Stephen Strasburg overpowering rotation Their three best hitter Anthony Rendon Juan Soto Trea Turner somehow never made AllStar team change summer
The reigning division champion prospectrich Atlanta Braves added third baseman Josh Donaldson catcher Brian McCann otherwise stood pat That may prove wise time leaf looking vulnerable pitcher Mike Foltynewicz AJ Minter Mike Soroka start season injured list
Injuries also struck early Mets tried build deeper roster winter open without infielder Jed Lowrie knee Todd Frazier oblique Frazier 33 Lowrie 34 second baseman Robinson Cano 36 But under30 hitter look good Jacob deGrom atop rotation Edwin Diaz closer Mets chance
I truly believe win said Brodie Van Wagenen new general manager He say course move encouraging probably enough given persistent injury risk roster change Mets spot standing
The Miami Marlins picked last place every reasonable forecast The chief executive Derek Jeter got wish team mechanical home run sculpture moved outside Marlins Park The display whimsical fun would used much anyway player threadbare roster hit 13 homer last season

2019 MLB Season Preview
By James Wagner
Aaron Judge one talented recognizable player baseball A largerthanlife outfielder toothy grin devastating swing Judge American League rookie year runnerup valuable player voting 2017 bestselling jersey Major League Baseball last two season
He playing valuable team sport paid waterfall big contract offseason Bryce Harper Manny Machado signed freeagent contract worth combined 630 million team committed 175 billion contract extension including eyepopping 360 million new money 10 year Mike Trout Los Angeles Angels
Judges cut 2019 season get full swing Thursday Baltimore Orioles A hair 684000
Few would quibble salary 11 time higher median household income United States 2017 But sport took 10 billion revenue last year complex question economic structure emerging amid rising tension team owner player union As team increasingly rely younger cheaper player shift freeagency priority young star like Judge expect earn predecessor And even arent player earning money productive age
Something need change Judge turn 27 late April said recently adding They find fair way evaluate player younger age
He far superstar make well market value In 2017 Chicago Cubs Kris Bryant 25 earned 1 million winning 2016 National League MVP Award World Series title Mets Jacob deGrom agreed contract extension Tuesday reluctantly accepted 607000 salary 2016 28 NL rookie year 2014 helping Mets World Series 2015
Carlos Correa 2015 rookie year AllStar 2017 made le 535000 first three season Houston Astros receiving discretionary raise 1 million 2018
Players like Aaron Judge like Kris Bryant contribute much team reaching arbitration making major league minimum salary producing like player making much said Correa 24 shortstop earn 5 million season going salary arbitration first time
The current salary structure place decade Teams control player right first six major league season generally owing least minimum salary 555000 2019 first three player become eligible negotiate salary salary arbitration process Judge enter next season next three After sign team open market
Such low salary used palatable player given promise big payday reached free agency But promise drying Fewer team competing eight team least 95 loss last season history club wary aging player production dropping since drug testing began luxury tax deterred spending analyticsdriven front office evaluating player similar way driving bidding war player
The freeagent market shifted drastically past two offseasons team become leery handing lengthy contract older player leaving younger one like Judge feeling squeezed end
You cant play side said Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton 29 signed 13year 325 million contract extension Miami Marlins 2014 one season arbitration You cant say Oh break well see theyre proven Oh well theyre old
Stanton said Judge could expect rewarded free agency way similar player past He aware knowledgeable situation I changed Stanton said
The Yankees could given Judge heftier raise 62000 bump got 2019 season much Tampa Bay Rays could given 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell 15500 raise 573700 2019 Snell since agreed fiveyear 50 million extension Neither team obligated based collective bargaining agreement
Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said team prearbitration salary formula based player service time performance Its strength built consistency said Weve stayed disciplined
Keeping salary Judge young standouts like 26yearold catcher Gary Sanchez 669800 24yearold third baseman Miguel Andujar 617600 22yearold second baseman Gleyber Torres 605200 allows Yankees spend elsewhere fill roster hole stay within budget As thing stand Yankees 2019 payroll luxury tax threshold 206 million
But player valuable Judge In 2018 earned 622300 actually worth 71 million Yankees according Block Six Analytics firm based Chicago Block Six devised metric called Revenue Above Replacement attempt calculate player value team based factor like merchandise sale attendance social medium influence television rating
By Block Six estimate Judge still worth least 33 million year early 30 despite natural decline onfield performance
Stars still star Adam Grossman founder chief executive Block Six Analytics said
But Judge received 18 million signing bonus 2013 firstround pick reach major league age 24 spent three year playing college baseball part three minor league He become free agent age31 season team might willing hand Machado Harperlevel contract age
His teammate though feel deserves type paycheck
What people need realize say taking Judge example he one best best Yankees starting pitcher James Paxton 30 said If look best world compensated A lot
Next season Judge likely become multimillionaire arbitration That route offer little longterm security deal last one season Given uncertain nature free agency sport gone small explosion contract extension spring The Yankees could offer Judge huge extension arbitration Luis Severino 25 last month deal would likely come close Machado Harper earned virtue reaching free agency 26 abnormally young age
The player union argued team wielded analytics justify paying free agent le money ignoring quality like leadership experience
The suggestion player particular age falling cliff excuse used drive player salary Tony Clark executive director MLB Players Association said
MLB labeled distribution problem Dan Halem deputy commissioner said player portion revenue relatively consistent past decade arbitration salary risen topearning free agent taking away rest
Its pretty easy say Lets pay younger player let continue pay free agent theyre getting paid Halem said That system doesnt work u overall amount going player hasnt changed distributed among free agent differently
Theres salary inequity among player superstar getting free agent valued way club getting le
MLB player association said open discussing compensation structure negotiation expected begin sometime opening day Some player suggested starting arbitration free agency sooner player career
Clark said union would consider option properly compensate player experience level Halem said MLB would listen long cumulative spending player remained historical norm
In meantime Judge remains exceedingly valuable superstar making vastly le worth team He said Yankees broached subject potential extension yet Cashman said premature comment Judges future Yankees beyond remaining four year team control
Were excited he done think he going continue Cashman said
In clubhouse business baseball come lot conversation among player including Judge Hopefully make change get guy paid theyre worth value pitcher C C Sabathia 38 said
Asked thought Judge worth Stanton corner outfield partner grinned
Definitely many people making said

In era new complex baseball statistic venerable one still pop frequently conversation among even geekiest statheads batting average
Its one easiest understand 300 good 200 Mendoza line dont want drop If want praise player youre likely get mileage fan saying Hes hitting 280 citing WAR BABIP
But even statistical Neanderthals know batting average seriously flawed measure offensive performance It great evaluating player ability hit single batter get credit power speed batting eye
What statistic easy understand batting average accounted thing batting average
Well Its called secondary average invented influential statistician Bill James 1970s Unlike many Jamess innovation caught heavily fan cant find stats website back baseball card
But secondary average useful tool quickly evaluate player offense identifying player underrated overrated batting average
Secondary average look work lot like batting average But rather focusing hit total add batter offensive skill extra base walk stolen base divide atbats Some formula secondary average also include hitbypitch others reduce total caught stealing Were using simplest formula
Lets use Dee Gordon Seattle Mariners example He 268 batting average last season 20 point higher league average 248 But secondary average mere 151 extrabase hit even fewer walk

You dont really learn new scale understand secondary average It look work lot like batting average 300 good 200 Major leaguers collectively 248 batting average last season overall secondary average 271
One difference spectrum much wider While almost every player fall 200s 300s batting average plenty regular major leaguers secondary average 100 others 400 even 500
Here player largest increase traditional batting average secondary average last season
Of player qualified batting title last season leader secondary average Mike Trout Los Angeles Angels eyeopening 626 Trout solid 312 batting average hardly summed offense He healthy number extrabase hit including 39 home run led league walk 122 stole 24 base Jose Ramirez Cleveland 524 Mookie Betts Boston 508 behind top secondary average list
Some historical context make Trouts season look even impressive Babe Ruths career secondary average 608 Barry Bondss 621
At end reveals player like Gordon bring little beyond ability hit single
The Chicago White Sox Jon Jay spent last season Kansas City Arizona three home run drew 33 walk stole four base These rather anemic extra contribution led sad 150 secondary average compared 268 batting average one point behind Gordon Miguel Rojas Miami 156
Unsurprisingly Bryce Harpers 249 batting average last season sell contribution short He hit 34 home run led major 130 walk secondary average 507 Mention next time someone dismisses 250 hitter
A le heralded example Joey Gallo Texas His 206 batting average might make seem ready demotion Class AAA Nashville But 40 home run double 24 walk 74 gave robust secondary average 446 keeping slot Rangers outfield secure
While Phillies landed one highsecondaryaverage player Harper offseason rest winter haul didnt necessarily follow trend Philadelphia also traded Mariners Jean Segura whose 304 batting average seemed plant among game best shortstop But secondary average reveals something empty 304 Although Segura hit 29 double 10 home run walk total shaky 32 That add secondary average 200
Mario Mendoza career batting average 215 career secondary average 095 might approve

The extension first reported ESPN would establish Trout highestpaid baseball player annual basis topping 344 million Zack Greinke earning Arizona Diamondbacks sixyear 2065 million contract signed December 2015
From 2017 Mike Trout Baseballs Best Without Brand
While enormous amount money even recordbreaking contract doesnt necessarily bring Trout highest tier overall income professional athlete
While comparing contract across sport continent inherently difficult undertaking varied contractual structure tax burden bonus ancillary benefit clear even monster deal Trout would fall well short becoming world highest paid athlete annually
The soccer superstar Lionel Messi example expected earn 106 million euro 120 million per year Barcelona 2021 amount could rise 120 million euro certain incentive met The boxer Canelo Álvarez earn least 73 million annually fiveyear deal streaming service DAZN
Trout 27 also wont highest annual salary North American team sport In NBA Stephen Curry Golden State Warriors making 375 million season Houston Rockets James Harden earn 423 million annually fouryear 1693 million contract extension kick
The highestpaid NFL player Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers earns bit le Trout expected average 335 million fouryear 134 million contract though 987 million guaranteed Unlike Major League Baseball NFL NBA salary cap
Compared superstar sport Trout limited ability earn money outside game Baseball player typically arent wellknown nationally internationally counterpart major sport Trouts lack marketability lamented MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred
Trout number endorsement deal company including Rawlings Nike 2014 became first baseball player since Ken Griffey Jr get Nike signature cleat But baseball player ability move merchandise pale comparison basketball player soccer player endorsement contract reflect
Trout earns estimated 25 million endorsement annually according Forbes Kevin Durants endorsement deal Nike alone worth 300 million 10 year Harden earn 200 million 13 year Adidas LeBron James NBA Cristiano Ronaldo Portuguese soccer star Juventus lifetime deal Nike rumored worth 1 billion
While handful athlete earn contract annually Trout individual almost assuredly 2030 final year Trouts deal NBA contract last maximum five year exception soccer contract rarely longer either Boxers typically earn money fight fight golf tennis player simply claim share tournament prize money
But 2030 matter Trouts baseball career progress earn least 36 million priceless longterm assurance
He earned payout putting together seven astounding season begin career similar player productionwise age according Baseball Reference Hall Famers Frank Robinson Ken Griffey Jr Mickey Mantle Trout two American League Most Valuable Player Awards runnerup four time His career batting average 307 major active leader onbase plus slugging percentage 990
But adding Trouts lack recognition earning power postseason success eluded He reached playoff 2014 Angels swept Kansas City Royals division series The possibility Trout departing new team loomed 2020 season sixyear 1445 million contract set expire Harper one said would love Trout join Philadelphia
Trout still life hometown Millville NJ offseason diehard Philadelphia Eagles fan But Angels tried impress upon Trout benefit keeping work home life separate sell idea oneteam icon franchise thrived And promise enormous paycheck least onfield performance Angels put together winning pitch

His real name Marvin Eugene Throneberry meant initial spelled MET Originally Yankee joined Mets May 1962 spirit thing immediately started tripping His crowning moment came game June playing first base called interference top first bottom inning failed touch first second base hitting triple When teammate Charlie Neal followed home run Stengel came dugout pointed base Neals benefit

With Vietnam War dragging 1969 good year discussing characterbuilding value military
From distance half century however seems rather clear least loopy young Mets franchise spine stiffened two men trained United States Marines
Two steeliest people Mets clubhouse Gil Hodges manager Tom Seaver pitcher later known The Franchise Both could turn downright taut eye narrowing jaw tightening speech clipped reporter broadcaster fan even Mets ballplayer acted Same Old Mets
We reporter worst I know I conditioned believe Mets fun terminally hapless
Wipe smile face Mister This laughing matter

Hodges part Mets first goofy day spring training 1962 Casey Stengel filibustering catch public attention Hodges happy back Los Angeles wife home borough Brooklyn beloved grand decadeplus Dodgers His knee shot Marvin Eugene Throneberry check initial became regular first baseman immortal Met blunderer
The Mets adequate enough benefit Hodgess Boys Summer way thing He became manager Washington Senators felt apprenticeship Mets job offered 1968
Seaver arrived farm system 1967 growing fast Marines later learning game Rod Dedeaux University Southern California In way Seaver normal young man early 20 full energy whooping laugh prank teammate He could also The New York Times crossword puzzle converse writer When playing bring time Marine Corps Reserve 196263 later talked proudly
I mediocre student Seaver recalled Veterans Day Nov 11 2011 ceremony Manhattan honoring military veteran If didnt ball involved I wasnt much interested But Marines sharpened focus
The principle I learned boot camp principle I took mound said Focus dedication I wouldnt made without Marine Corps
Seaver mentioned picture taken mound locked attention playing national anthem You look foot theyre military position absolutely said Thats discipline instilled Its important reason Im Cooperstown
It clear much Seaver Hodges discussed Marine root They served vastly different circumstance Seaver stateside Hodges facing incoming kamikaze pilot Pacific Theater
Hodges college boy southern Indiana noticeable muscle Stengel one franchisebuilding conversational ramble said Hodges strong could squeeze earbrows Nobody knew earbrow nobody wanted ask
I mentor newspaper business young Columbia University dropout baseball freak sent island Okinawa There rumor large young Marine island major league ballplayer The Dodgers let Hodges play one game third base 1943 shipped

When Hodges became star Dodgers often went movie free time A friend accompanied said Hodges would grow solemn scene combat would pray Amen every fallen military person
Hodges carried Marine steel manager uniform When reporter made joke smiled weakly politely encourage levity cynicism

Keeping Score
By Benjamin Hoffman
Ronald Acuna Jr 21 year 106 day old He played 115 game major league level He hit 300 season reached 30 career home run Yet Tuesday Atlanta Braves agreed contract lock eight year record price player age 100 million
And Braves ridiculous may sound almost assuredly got bargain
The contract Acuna carry age28 season includes team option could keep Atlanta he 30 continued trend spring player seemingly wary slowing free agent market signing extension team earlier usual For player lock large payday relatively young age postpone entry free agency process decade considered best way maximize career earnings
Mike Trout prominent player sign huge extension offseason agreeing 360 million extension Angels two year set become free agent Nolan Arenado supposed jewel next year freeagent class signed 234 million extension Colorado instead Chris Sale got 145 million Boston Jacob deGrom got 1375 million Mets Paul Goldschmidt got 130 million St Louis Alex Bregman got 100 million Houston
And ninefigure deal
The extension spree may seem like baseball lavishing player cash club wary enormous freeagent deal like one signed Bryce Harper Manny Machado season way save money long run lock player early wont reach free agency age maximize payday And player unwilling endure year lower pay process Harper Machado went agreeing take le overall money exchange dose security
That seems especially relevant case Acuna outfielder already done much young age two player easily compared Harper Machado
Last year Rookie Year Awardwinning campaign Acuna accounted 41 win replacement 20yearold despite playing 111 game Going way back John McGraw 1893 24 position player age 20 younger recorded season WAR figure least 40 according Baseball Reference That group includes 12 Hall Famers three player Trout Harper Machado Hall Fame track Alex Rodriguez player complicated Hall Fame case becomes eligible certainly put Hall Fame number
Of member group Claudell Washington outfielder several team 1970s 1980s Dick Hoblitzell first baseman Cincinnati Boston early 20th century failed live early promise And there Jason Heyward despite sensational age 20 25 fell latter half 20
But even accounting limitation Washington Hoblitzell mixed result Heyward remains relatively solid decision gamble player star age 20 especially considering potential saving Braves
Had Acuna eschewed extension traditional path likely would spent season next one earning near major league minimum 555000 In 2021 would entered baseball arbitration process likely could commanded 10 million first year 20 million second year 25 million third year He would free agent 26 presumably setting deal worth 30 million per year
So realistically Acuna might cost 15 million lifetime deal another 25 million considering two 17 million team option team exercise end eight year He also unlikely hit open market turning 30 age player become much le likely receive lengthy highdollar contract
There plenty reason celebrate deal Acuna Braves A player organization since 16 get paid instead waiting payday road Atlanta secured face franchise much player prime But Braves upshot includes healthy bit saving long run

When Bryce Harper hit powerful eighthinning home run Tuesday night wrapped dramatic homecoming narrative But getting almost much buzz topnotch bat flip
It Harpers first game back Washington leaving Nationals join Philadelphia Phillies free agent offseason Before game made magnanimous statement Instagram thanking Nationals fan saying would always remember cheer
Nonetheless faced predictable deluge boo throughout game home fan Perhaps took cue mayor Muriel Bowser tweeted deleted picture Harper Benedict Arnold
Parked right field Harper play group noisy Phillies fan Harper took moment salute
He started slowly two strikeout But double runscoring single In final atbat powered shot second deck right fittingly Phillies fan
That brought bat flip The typical home run flip come immediately swing tends horizontal Sometimes performed enthusiasm sometimes arrogance
But Harper took time He switched hand heaved onehanded The toss good height tremendous speed completing several rapid rotation
That followed home run trot complex series fist bump pose teammate dugout
Bat flip cause hard feeling opposing player tend feel violates unwritten code game Some flip cleared bench
Nationals Manager Davey Martinez concerned shortstop Trea Turners broken finger game I try watch said asked thought bat flip Its way game evolved
Flips unlikely become disciplinary issue like steroid beanball Major League Baseball cant upset considering posted video highlighting top 50 bat flip time
And unwritten code really translate baseball culture In South Korea flamboyant flip draw shrug scorn
Some memorable flippery
The nonchalant flip Junior Lakes slow deliberate flip 2015 prompted onfield brouhaha
The disdainful flip Albert Pujols dripped derision delayed toss 2009
The historic flip Barry Bonds tied home run record 70 2001 executed soft high looping flip seemed would never come
The longdelayed flip Jose Ramirez annoyed Twins 2015 flip came halfway first base
The famous flip Jose Bautistas flip 2015 division series yet bettered His homer broke tie deciding game series After swing Bautista stood immobile plate watching ball performed muscular hurl sent bat deep foul territory
Hes stuff kid Wiffle ball game Rangers reliever Sam Dyson groused
Thats Wiffle ball game many people might like see

The Tampa Bay Rays arrived Toronto weekend winning record American League East They 103 entering Fridays game 198 team earned run average easily best major league
And used opener twice Creating position opener essentially reliever start game work inning two helped Rays surge 90 victory last season But notion Tampa Bay intended blow pitching know always misguided
The Rays AL Cy Young Award winner last season Blake Snell signed fiveyear 50 million contract extension March Their No 2 starter Charlie Morton signed free agent December earn 15 million season next highest salary team history
Their third fourth starter Tyler Glasnow Yonny Chirinos 25 combined go 50 first five start allowing two run 29 inning 32 strikeout four walk
So yes Rays believe elite starting pitching They believe mediocre pitching kind much far
We tried put position lot interesting depth said Chaim Bloom Rays senior vice president baseball operation Theres lot guy great upside
Morton 35 took year realize upside young pitcher Atlanta Pittsburgh He finally discovered Houston Astros learned attack hitter curveballs high fastball instead trying induce contact sinker He Game 7 American League Championship Series World Series 2017 earned first AllStar selection last season
Morton love traditional role starting pitcher
I grew idolizing starting pitcher fan standpoint someone thats starter whole career essentially I would like see starting pitcher always place game Morton said Theres balance poetic nature game nostalgic part game flow mystical part winloss part win Were trying find balance
Last summer trading Chris Archer Pittsburgh Glasnow outfielder Austin Meadows Nathan Eovaldi Boston Rays found balance regular use opener allowing pitcher like Chirinos Ryan Yarbrough work bulk game reliever gone tough hitter start
Chirinos pitched four seven inning last 10 appearance last season without starting game His ERA game 304 Yarbrough went 166 started six time The Rays adjust role season based matchup maximize chance success avoid dreaded mediocrity
The Yankees Boston Red Sox always significant financial edge Rays whose 60 million payroll le combined 2019 salary Yankees Giancarlo Stanton Masahiro Tanaka Jacoby Ellsbury
But Tampa Bay supplementing major league roster product farm system Baseball America ranked No 2 game San Diegos Shortstop Wander Franco pitcher Brent Honeywell twoway player Brendan McKay rank among MLBcoms top 30 prospect
Thats Bloom said Weve put lot effort last year making sure system deep robust possible We need depth need topend talent need steady flow championshipcaliber player put lot energy focus
It early course young player helped Rays open biggest lead AL East since midMay 2011 led two half game
Their current player major league roster Morton naturally With home Bradenton Fla four young child found perfect spot contract said would last career
I didnt know expect historically Rays havent spent lot money freeagent starting pitching ever Morton said So I wasnt thinking Im guy When called got impression going pretty aggressive I started get excited wife got excited We tried get hope knew ideal situation But work way kind unbelievable
Kramer Robertson 10 year old 2005 first time cut basketball net celebrate NCAA championship Baylor Lady Bears The second time 2012 17
Last Sunday though grown playing Springfield Cardinals Class AA team St Louis farm system Robertson could Tampa Fla national title game mother Kim Mulkey Baylor coach sister Makenzie Fuller associate director team operation
Instead Robertson Cardinals team bus halfway Fayetteville Ark Tulsa Okla huddled teammate around phone streaming broadcast Just minute tipoff Mulkey sent text message game Now watching exulting afar Lady Bears beat Notre Dame thriller 8281
We middle nowhere barely service I fired Robertson shortstop said phone day The first thing I thought FaceTime brotherinlaw I expecting answer I excited I wanted bad But said Connecting first face I saw mom I didnt know say I started screaming
Robertsons brotherinlaw Clay Fuller former minor leaguer Los Angeles Angels His father Randy Robertson former quarterback Louisiana Tech Kim Mulkey AllAmerican point guard She coached Baylor since 2000 turning around team went 720 season arrived setting powerful example son
Ive seen shes handled failure success humility never wavered moral said She always taught Nothing great ever get done without enthusiasm Ive remembered throughout baseball career especially minor league get monotonous easy get complacent
There little chance Tuesday Tulsa Drillers started Clayton Kershaw threetime Cy Young Award winner making rehabilitation start recovers shoulder soreness Kershaw scheduled start Los Angeles Dodgers Monday pitched five shutout inning Robertson led sixth home run high fastball
It first homer season Robertson gave highlight memorable week family Back home Texas mother watching
I got phone mom excited Robertson said She like No didnt Normally I would try play situation like I going embrace moment try cool That special
Groundskeepers Atlantic League stand There movement pitcher mound season common sense prevails anytime soon
With strikeout rate rising every season since 2006 Major League Baseball searching way stimulate action field The independent Atlantic League testing ground experimental playing rule The radical proposal scheduled take effect midseason distance pitching rubber home plate moved back two foot 62 foot 6 inch
On Wednesday Atlantic League announced change would delayed second half 2020 season another change use radar tracking technology help umpire call ball strike would introduced gradually season opening day late April
Given fragile nature pitcher arm moving back mound first time since 1893 would seem invite even injury risk The change could also discourage pitcher joining Atlantic League possible injury distance affiliated ball athlete aspire remains 606
Any pitcher significant major league time I think would apprehensive try make change stage career said agent Tom OConnell whose client Jon Niese signed Long Island Ducks Wednesday Thankfully going make decision But I would concerned next year Im former major league player thats trying make comeback concerned

What specifically I represented wrong way Coming suspension2 I wanted honest accurate fair medium mix levity I could wait make fun Doing made everybody relax Id wake next morning thinking I going get crushed mistake Id made But Id see theyd barely talking expletive Id beat punch I still think part I good relationship medium became excellent postsuspension
Did depiction villain feel like misrepresentation I would booed I felt tough guy answer robotic right thing I wrong I think OK I say I dont know answer
This almost philosophical thing baseball long history player using performance enhancer Ball Four3 talk guy gobbling amphetamine game And Im thinking conjunction point Malcolm Gladwell made4 The New Yorker player arent allowed take PEDs OK get Tommy John surgery also completely unnatural method aiding career Does seem arbitrary baseball say PEDs cheating certain thing arent I dont know I think time well able determine whats
Of bigtime baseball player implicated steroid era seem done best better guy like Barry Bonds Roger Clemens coming controversy positive way Why I speak anybody else If youre asking I think started taking full responsibility misstep I paid huge price longest suspension history MLB PED use And I away I took year reflect I wanted understand I kept shooting foot I wish foot actually
What understanding arrive Im still work progress one thing I learned I good enough I need overreach And I turned lens inward I found incredible amount gratitude appreciation respect others way perhaps past With attitude I able enjoy life better It made nicer person around made better father
Before making personal realization youve described distorting fame selfconception decisionmaking I went high school prom several month later I playing Fenway Park I good enough physically mentally I still high school I never make excuse benefiting college campus four year time evolve I lost way somewhere along line
How aware emotional disconnect moment You know something doesnt feel right What find Ive never thought way suppress voice thats telling wrong thing
This maybe shot dark suspension really cause 180degree epiphany Or maybe aftermath gave way understanding story allowed move forward emotionally publicly Well suspension first happened I pissed everyone I blaming everyone It wasnt I got deeper I said No fault Its fault
Were therapy time Thats I got
Is culture therapy majorleague baseball Whats common baseball performance coach Thats totally different deep therapy serious business It hardest thing Ive ever In many way rewiring brain
Before suspension adviser ever discus coming clean PEDs Or strategy always deny deny deny This part I want make sure superclear Because I want story thats fact trying expletive I think I didnt tool I today Lets go next one David well come back thats real important I want make sure I address clear way
How consciously youve transitioned playing tried build new brand persona Today I showed I didnt know anything youd want talk Id rather way Before I would studied six month sitting I wanted buttonedup done due diligence seen angle Now I trust going good conversation I go
What persona brand trying build back Robotic tough Very serious
How Details photo shoot kissing reflection mirror fit image I cringe that5 We ending photo shoot I wanted run I think Steven Klein photographer like Lets shoot one And Im like What I want eat burger Let get
Were burger part diet back No I probably starving Yeah I kissed mirror even thinking But I lot thing like I took shirt Central Park decided get sun middle day6
Knowing people would see take photograph right In Central Park
Yes No Because think youll 15 20 minute get sun Im pale hell Again even situation I would handled levity humility I would defused entire thing
Theres rumor portrait centaur 100 percent true I wish true cool story
What Jennifer Lopez7 taught public figure Shes obviously skilled Ive never met anyone who honest Shes authentic genuine It strange see someone magnitude normal great mother partner friend How like go perform front 80000 people But thats superpower
Why balancing public private self way struggle I dont know I wish I
How hard cultural transition sport business Theres financial language thats different way theyre exactly What want create winning culture incentive package based team winning If youre careful put wrong incentive package create culture everyone fighting The thing go baseball
There expectation sport player sacrifice benefit team But professional athlete business arent personal incentive fundamentally odds incentive team management rewarded team performance Or whole ethos subsuming individual selfinterest team bunch romantic horse crap perpetuated vested interest athlete continuing think way8 Look I played 22 year one championship9 Dan Marino Charles Barkley didnt championship day I know hear echo I feared So 09 amazing experience half relief But I also already made small fortune Itd probably different asked I hadnt signed contract10 Then becomes question would rather hit 330 win 270 win Thats get little tricky
Because battingaverage difference equates difference million dollar salary Tens million But unique player truly winning Johnny Damon Derek Jeter Andy Pettitte Dustin Pedroia
Do include list I I I also incredible passion great But yeah probably I Thats I moved third base shortstop Thats example putting team ahead
Your life baseball player regimented Do miss structure I predictable schedule I nothing predictable baseball season I love structure I list 10 thing I I would check every night I went bed see many Id done I maniacal work ethic When I 19 year old I played guy name Joey Cora11 Hes 5foot7 good day knee problem I saw arriving stadium 11 morning 7 oclock game I saw way took care body work get ready play And I young shortstop hitting 358 Im going stretch competing MVP nothing hurt I felt like I could rip wall wall would hurt right God good old day But I remember sitting watching Joey Cora Im like His body hurt He doesnt complain He get clubhouse earlier earlier And I said If I take Godgiven ability type hunger desire Ill take chance
Do still checklist look every night I Im old school I remember thing better I write The day Jennifer said something brilliant like 2 morning I reached get notebook everything fall floor Then I grabbed wrote
Whatd say It Mariano Rivera She said Mo getting 100 percent12 tell greatness field field I thought Thats true I played year I couldnt come
When playing ever see another player think better If take away first year last season I dont think I ever saw
Would answer different youd played Barry Bonds I played Barry Interleague
Do look anyone business world way kid looked say Cal Ripken Think Jamie Dimon done JP Morgan Barry Sternlicht Starwood Jon Gray Blackstone Obviously Babe Ruth Warren Buffett
Buffetts philanthropy impressive My passion giving back education Ive opportunity coteach class Stanford Business School
What class Reputation management
Was key lesson authenticity That definitely And afraid pivoting
Something shortstop good How getting rich young age change relationship people around You young kid learned play baseball Boys Girls Clubs Then climb system become No 1 draft pick You bypass college At 21 get 10 million contract crazy Then get contract break alltime record sport Usually journey arc many year happened seven eight year high school So culture shock around Theres preparation
What effect culture shock People around think cash Whatever read paper signed feel like someone came Brinks truck dumped money garage And whatever reason people think Wheres cut When doesnt happen grow resentment disappointment
Lets revisit question I asking earlier Before suspended idea coming clean PEDs ever discussed Ive taken position owning everything At point maybe future I feel like answer I would like give oncamera I think people see sincerity Im giving straight I respect I dont want think Im expletive way So thats Id rather step away say David Id rather answer Im ready give truth yet Does make sense
I think I understand youre saying Whats one piece advice athlete trying transition business You find people experienced conservative alignment moral compass There many pitfall along way someone doesnt moral compass therell trouble

There little anxiety pitching staff thanks Yankees potent lineup After setting major league record 267 home run last season Yankees predicted would top year
With two home run first game pace First baseman Greg Bird also homered rightcenter field eighth inning The blast helped cancel boo Bird struck first three atbats
But Thursday least started Voit About year ago St Louis Cardinals Class AAA team Memphis The Yankees needing first baseman injury underperformance saw Voit undervalued player acquired minor trade July
Given chance play proved crucial Yankees playoff push He hit 14 home run 39 game started Yankees playoff game He battled Bird firstbase job year ended openingday roster thanks nagging back injury center fielder Aaron Hicks
And Voits first major league opening day Yankees trusted power spot lineup fourth behind fellow slugger Aaron Judge Giancarlo Stanton After Judge Stanton singled Orioles starter Andrew Cashner Voit came saw low slider fifth pitch Listed 6 foot 3 inch 225 pound Voit powerful swing sent ball centerfield fence
To first opening day hit home run pretty special Voit said something Ill remember rest life
A couple caveat noted victory It Orioles worst record baseball last season On hand Yankees squad yet whole
Pitcher C C Sabathia serving fivegame suspension stemming incident threw Jesus Sucre last fall spend addition time injured list still building offseason operation heart knee He expected return sometime April reliever Dellin Betances Hicks also supposed back Severino May Shortstop Didi Gregorius expected back elbow surgery summer

And even Gardner 35 recall time especially week season 11 teammate injured list
Man said pausing tied cleat visitor clubhouse Camden Yards I cant tell there many IL But far guy going something within day frustrating
Between suddenly packed trainer room field start Yankees 2019 season frustrating Among preseason World Series favorite Yankees dropped first two series year rebuilding Baltimore Orioles Detroit Tigers team lost combined 213 game last year could easily top total season The first two home run Aaron Judges season goahead threerun blast Clint Frazier eighth inning helped Yankees overcome mistake 64 win Orioles Saturday improving record 44
Eight game course blip baseball season Yankees team expected contend sputtered gate The defending champion Boston Red Sox started 28 thanks pitching woe mental mistake Chicago Cubs hitting pitching led 26 start Houston Astros 2017 World Series winner scored 24 run good 45 record
Its long season Gardner said Yankees win Thursday If went 24 week sometime May June might big deal But first six game season obviously judge point Spring training
When Yankees left spring training home Tampa Fla though already alarming number key player recovering injury shortstop Didi Gregorius elbow surgery last year relief pitcher Dellin Betances right shoulder inflammation outfielder Aaron Hicks back stiffness Jacoby Ellsbury hip surgery last year starting pitcher Luis Severino right shoulder soreness C C Sabathia offseason knee heart operation
Since opening day joined IL third baseman Miguel Andujar torn right labrum outfielder Giancarlo Stanton left biceps strain shortstop Troy Tulowitzki left calf strain Altogether thats 11 player 87 million 2019 salary IL entire opening day payroll Pittsburgh Pirates Miami Marlins Tampa Bay Rays Orioles according Cots Baseball Contracts
Its really crazy Tulowitzki said adding later Ive never seen anything like
Injuries inevitable long season especially player like Tulowitzki 34yearold returning yearandahalf absence hurt And even towering list hobbled player Yankees take encouragement recent history
The last major league team many player IL six game season 2016 Los Angeles Dodgers according Nathan Currier injurytracking site ManGamesLostcom Buoyed deep 250 million roster Dodgers went win National League West advance NL Championship Series year despite setting record 28 player IL
So really could always worse Yankees At one point last June Los Angeles Angels 15 player injury And reinforcement way Sabathia Betances perhaps even Stanton expected return month Hicks resuming baseball activity could return closer May Severino also expected back Andujars injury concerning team respond well rehabilitation could need seasonending surgery
Those big piece missing starting pitcher James Paxton said Itll great get guy back get back But right Im confident going battle guy Weve got guy grinder
The Yankees proud improved depth entering season bolstered pitching staff added infielder D J LeMahieu Gold Glovewinning everyday second baseman Colorado Rockies signed jackofalltrades bench player New York But Yankees expect reach far depth early After Tulowitzki went healthy infielder 40man roster call Thairo Estrada Yankees 19thranked prospect missed last season shot right hip robbery attempt native Venezuela winter Estradas stay major league lasted one game Yankees swapped spot infielder Giovanny Urshela stout defender past major league experience play lot third base
The star infielder Manny Machado free agent offseason would help Yankees immensely But decided winter asking price high eventually signed San Diego Padres record 300 million 10 year could spread money around various addition relying Gleyber Torres Andujar LeMahieu Tulowitzki
The result opening day payroll nearly 204 million le 2015 218 million 2016 226 million according Cots Baseball Contracts The Yankees 206 million luxurytax threshold take account entire 40man roster yearly salary calculated differently
That roster secondmost expensive major behind Red Sox hobbled gate Manager Aaron Boone maintained long view
Were always capable going roll said Thats matter time Thats matter u starting click together getting guy hot collectively lineup getting pitcher settled Even banged Im confident go run point
Underlying concern remain even among healthy member roster While closer Aroldis Chapmans velocity slowly trending fastball velocity small sample four game 965 mile per hour entering Saturday 2 mph slower last season 4 mph slower 2017 Pitchers sometimes take time build velocity colder month Chapman used slider ever He pitched around single save Saturday
On offense team without portion lineup accounted 119 majorleaguerecord 267 home run last year Andujar Gregorius Hicks Stanton With capable le powerful hitter filling Boone said Yankees may rely speed contact
And there catcher Gary Sanchez hoping bounce back worst allaround season career offseason operation nonthrowing shoulder He teamleading three home run also four throwing error six stolen base allowed baserunning blunder
Given drain talent IL Yankees margin error shrunk Defensive baserunning error loom larger The lineup strike teamrecord 18 time strand baserunners one worst rate baseball expect win
Obviously injury there pressure u said Luke Voit designated hitter slumping blasted threerun homer Thursdays win Just trying much instead At end day going come around I smile fun
The Yankees could always look outside addition patch hole But meantime team need role player contribute expected standouts pull weight LeMahieu lead Yankees hitting 11 24 Torres time last year carried Yankees victory Thursday two critical home run First baseman Greg Bird Voit Sanchez Gardner batting average le 227 Judge struck teamhigh 16 time Frazier missed last year concussion hit major league home run since July 28 2017 Saturday

Wes Johnson first pitching coach jump college major part techsavvy generation eschews eyeball test
By Tyler Kepner
When Wes Johnson started coaching career 2003 Abundant Life high school Sherwood Ark quickly learned needed win Invariably team would end season losing close playoff game dominant pitcher Johnson began quest find build ace
His skill led several college job recently pitching coach University Arkansas platform unusual leap season Minnesota Twins Johnson believed first pitching coach jump college major league
In Johnsons first game March 28 starter Jose Berrios bullpen gave kind victory eluded 20 gem Cleveland Indians The Twins totaled 39 strikeout 13 game threegame opening series encouraging sign staff struggled year master art power pitching
The Indians trouble four starter topped 200 strikeout last season helping team win third consecutive American League Central title For Twins challenge need Johnsons pitcher respond modernized approach relies heavily biomechanics
Im going come tell Johnson said repeating told Twins top baseball official Derek Falvey Thad Levine job interview The biggest thing Why something And going subjective Its going 100 percent objective science data If going make change guy cant make change doesnt please eye
Johnson 47 personifies trend baseball pairing techsavvy coach generation player crave actionable data The coach pitching background largely irrelevant like Johnson new pitching coach Los Angeles Angels Doug White Seattle Mariners Paul Davis Cincinnati Reds Derek Johnson formerly Milwaukee Brewers never pitched affiliated professional league
Those four maybe never anything never played pro ball going cutting edge said Brent Strom 70 pitching coach Houston Astros Im glad Im getting theyre coming I might slyly get let take These guy know stuff
Before college coaching career wound Central Arkansas Dallas Baptist Mississippi State Arkansas Johnson connected Strom Pat Harrison mutual friend Strom invited Johnson clinic featuring Paul Nyman pioneer sport science emphasized momentum balance pitcher delivery research rather conventional wisdom support theory
At smaller college especially Johnson tended polished prospect signed professionally chosen larger program To compete specialized development imparting lesson learned Nyman Strom others like Ron Wolforth founder Texas Baseball Ranch hosted clinic attended
Wolforth cited Johnsons personality curiosity reason unlikely rise
Hes bubbly bounce wall energy Wolforth said For first 10 year high school Central Arkansas Dallas Baptist started experiment thing find worked would add next brick Some thing accepted dogma Wes really interested different perspective He looked thing upside
Falvey former Indians executive joined Twins chief baseball officer October 2016 met Johnson Wolforth clinic followed afar When Twins fired Paul Molitor manager last season restructured coaching staff Falvey former pitcher Trinity College turned Johnson intrigued many year studying craft
Theres argument made college circle last year anyway may using information technology pro side Falvey said adding later In professional game traditional way getting field You finish playing become coach There real inbetween step learning developing
Strom pitch professionally five major league season 1970s Astros pitcher respond information ability convey The Astros staff led major strikeout last season Strom said Twins could similarly transformed
Theyre going much much better Wes said For year Twins always reputation inducing contact wouldnt strike many people It reminded I Cardinals induce ground ball sinker kind stuff Wes bringing fourseam fastball elevated pitch sequencing pitch know delivery well he studied
It go show player dont really care care care Wes really care He care player
The Twins needed change In eight full season since last division title 2010 fewest strikeout per nine inning major 679 They pitching contact poor result allowing 305 average ball play season worse every staff except Colorados inducing soft contact 176 percent time matching Arizona worst figure according FanGraphs
Last season though Twins set franchise record strikeout 1377 almost precisely league average But also issued 573 walk 22 year Johnson said Twins would use data devise effective pitch sequence tailored pitcher stuff physiology
Ive asked question Whats pitching philosophy Johnson said Well Ive got one Mike Pineda Ive got completely different one Martin Perez Kyle Gibson Jake Odorizzi Because body work different stuff play different need different thing training room Some guy need momentum guy dont need much momentum Some guy throw across body theyve got loose hip may change guy But another guy throw across body he got tight hip youve got change
That last idea brought smile Jim Kaat ace Twins 1965 AL championship team Kaat television analyst Twins MLB Network thrived pitching coach Johnny Sain progressive instructor time understood spin better contemporary encouraged hip rotation rudimentary drill
We thing oldfashioned method actually show could improve 5 percent 10 percent Kaat said All stuff Johnny would interested sure
The method measurement changed But wisest pitcher coach desire evolve never end

CLEARWATER Fla John Middleton knew opportunity saw He 9 year old September 1964 sitting father upper deck third base Connie Mack Stadium Philadelphia The Phillies coasting World Series seemed leading National League six half game 12 play
But sixth inning scoreless tie Cincinnati Reds Phillies notice boy Havertown Pa picked The runner third Chico Ruiz itching steal home
I looked father I said Dad look faroff base guy he gon na go home Middleton said last Sunday office Phillies training complex And next pitch went home I mean really obvious He extraordinary lead We devastated
The rest seared psyche every Phillies fan Middletons generation Starting Ruizs dash Phillies lost 10 game row blow pennant It took 16 year win first World Series another 28 win next championship They winning season since 2011 year Bryce Harper 19 reached major league Washington Nationals
More half century later Middleton Phillies managing partner turned Harper sixtime AllStar lead back On March 2 Middleton signed Harper 13year 330 million contract longest richest freeagent deal major league history
It expensive deal offseason Mike Trout Millville NJ native Harper tried recruit Phillies since signed 12year 4265 million contract extension Los Angeles Angels But Harpers contract partnership two party prior relationship represents baseball lucrative leap faith For Middleton opportunity could resist
I approach job fan first said Middleton sold family tobacco business Altria parent company Philip Morris USA 29 billion 2007 The day I stop thinking like fan day I stop feeling Im fan thats day I need retire
Now course Middleton kind perk could dream 1980 watched Phillies win World Series distant 600 level right field Veterans Stadium To complete Harper deal Middleton team control person since 2016 flew Las Vegas private jet wife Leigh met several hour Harper 26 wife Kayla
It deeply personal conversation The Middletons talked 40year marriage challenge balancing work family The Harpers met high school asked hospital school might need child Harper said struck way Middleton looked eye showing understanding Harpers goal deal made life decision baseball one
Understand family mean world wife mom dad everybody said Harper interest optout clause I want able sit kid grow somewhere move around go go time come For opportunity play somewhere 13 year try understand city city part Thats greatest thing could ever happen
Middleton team powerful link history The team president Andy MacPhail General Manager Matt Klentak Manager Gabe Kapler coach hired elsewhere tie proud provincial city Institutional memory important Philadelphia Middleton
I think Philadelphia fan probably feel John Middletons one said Mike Schmidt greatest player Phillies history Hes one people one guy
Can Harper Philly guy Growing Las Vegas said father Ron set example ironworker help relate new home
My dad blue collar Harper said He worked 2 morning til 1 afternoon grinded every single day It take freaking lunch pail work job I grew family like I around people like family around people like theyll grow right way
As well Harper connected Middleton embraced idea playing Philadelphia interest He wanted contract would eclipse richest record Giancarlo Stantons 13year 325 million deal And Middletons emotional tie hometown team made kind owner Harpers agent Scott Boras needed investment
As datasavvy team increasingly keep emotion decisionmaking turning instead formulaic offer based cold data agent found harder appeal owner personal drive The frenzy old multiple team bidding aggressively free agent evolved painstaking process often bleeds deep spring training
So owner like Middleton stand Boras also paired starter Jake Arrieta Phillies last March three year 75 million contract In conversation Harper Middleton mentioned time lost high school wrestling championship referee bad call
He basically personalized competitiveness Boras said Whats funny owner dynamic people inside game concerned But actually increase winning also increase business
Look Bryce Harpers done Philadelphia
He indeed effect even playing game The Phillies started decade ranked first National League attendance dropped 12th 15 team last season 21 million total fan In eight day Harper news broke sold 340000 ticket The apparel company Fanatics said Harper set record sport firstday jersey sale PlayStation quickly applied image Harper Phillies jersey cover video game MLB The Show 19
Hes like rockstar baseball player Schmidt said From Middletons standpoint marketing people standpoint kid aura Mike Trout doesnt Now Mike Trouts number may dwarf kid sell stuff Hes pretty good career agewise experiencewise he coming heyday right I think thats Phillies banking
As significant offfield benefit may Middleton insists signed Harper solely win long happens said fan respond Middleton declared intention November told USA Today prepared spend money free agency maybe even little stupid The comment calculated Middleton said put public pressure Klentak staff
Klentak hired Phillies posted major worst record 2015 They lost 187 game across next two year ruined promising 2018 season limping stretch 8082 finish Middleton tired losing Arrieta said eager raise expectation
Our owner smart business people Klentak said referring also Buck family like Middleton owns 4825 percent Phillies They understand timing understand nature baseball theyve incredibly supportive process last year always encouraging u explore opportunity speed thing
Klentak found opportunity winter He added shortstop Jean Segura left fielder Andrew McCutchen reliever David Robertson catcher J T Realmuto spring training The task remaining cap extraordinary winter signing premier free agent Manny Machado Harper
Machado signed San Diego Padres Feb 21 10 year 300 million Phillies wanted pay By Middleton met Boras Clearwater possibly became first owner ever say five word baseball powerful agent I dont care money
Ive made enough money life Middleton recalled telling Boras The reason Im talking Bryce I believe he special player help u win get bleeping trophy back Our bleeping trophy
That echoed Middletons command slugger Ryan Howard 2009 visiting clubhouse Bronx Phillies ceded World Series title Yankees Asked vision Harper though Middleton modified message slightly
Of course craves moment like one last February watched beloved Eagles win Super Bowl suite owner Jeffrey Lurie But Middleton want Harper deal herald new era He want Phillies team town model franchise
Thats Id like Middleton said I look people time organization I say Why shouldnt great

But right around Halloween home Chapel Hill NC little repeatedly watching Finding Nemo 3yearold son wife received phone call Nick Krall Reds general manager
Theres long drawnout conversation storytelling Brice said He said We decided make move let go Weve got put
In case put meant removing Brice Reds 40man roster list includes player available regularseason game shortterm injured list selection minor leaguers called major time
So began MLBs version hot potato Brice potato When player removed 40man roster placed waiver point MLB team claim For Brice started paradoxically itinerant three month bounced around team team without moving much By time Miami Marlins signed Feb 4 club fourth offseason
A week earlier dropped Baltimore Orioles claimed infielder Jack Reinheimer joining fourth team offseason Brice tweeted I think I found Im hitting waiver I think team wanting put mustache picture b4 change 2019 season Its conspiracy But real waiver suck lol
Brice become resident MLBs man land exasperating limbo player find bubble 40man roster good enough get added necessarily good enough stay Its situation handful player find every offseason one bewildering endlessly frustrating testing player resolve fight way back major league
Hanser Alberto 26yearold infielder Dominican Republic experienced winter bounced around four team including two stint Baltimore The Angels twoway player Kaleb Cowart three team including twice joining Angels For player frustration compounded powerlessness prove
Its confusing Brice said cant defend play offseason
Alex Hassan assistant director player development Minnesota Twins went similar experience 201415 offseason making round three team ultimately landing Oakland Athletics spring
Each time youre added roster Hassan said youre trying create narrative head thing going work favor player If dont odds stacked youd go crazy
For club front office new signing set domino effect becomes hard stop When one position get filled often open need another team intensifies search Additionally player fill need one day become redundant next
At end 2015 season Andy Wilkins 30 minor leaguer Atlanta Braves powerhitting corner infielder yet translate minorleague success major One week Seattle Mariners signed December team traded veteran first baseman Adam Lind Wilkins referred majorleague version Wilkins dropped day later
Its evaluating player becomes available Brian Chattin Marlins assistant general manager said constant roster shuffling
After ending four different team threeweek span offseason Wilkins said I numb whole thing
When received call Milwaukee Brewers signed hospital wife given birth first child I didnt talk long said I like Whatever well see I get spring training guy

Jeter 36 skill declining believed deserved threeyear 51 million deal ultimately signed During heated exchange Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman later detailed Sports Illustrated article Jeter asked Cashman shortstop would rather
One player Cashman listed Troy Tulowitzki nine year later indeed patrolling shortstop Yankees opening day
I remember story said Tulowitzki 34 recent spring training workout I heard But You see GM trying job At time I going pretty good
He certainly much happened since
Jeter course retired 2014 season part owner chief executive Miami Marlins He replaced shortstop Didi Gregorius grown standout position
Tulowitzki player 2010 Colorado Rockies considered one best player baseball play plate field It first five AllStar season
But long list injury hampered large chunk Tulowitzkis prime year From 2010 2017 Tulowitzki averaged 107 game season
The last two year trying Because fractured right ankle 2017 surgery remove bone spur heel 2018 Tulowitzkis last major league game July 28 2017
It took toll said But Im still standing feel good I cant wait prove
Tulowitzki played edge whole career And speaks mind Rockies surprised blockbuster trade Blue Jays 2015 facing Toronto released offseason thought unlikely would healthy aboveaverage shortstop
Tulowitzki hit home run first spring training atbat Yankee Feb 25 Blue Jays le screamed toward old team dugout rounding base
That biggest spring training homer Ive ever hit said smile Anybody tell youre done youre going little extra fire
That excitement since faded harsh reality Tulowitzki faced major league pitching long time It spring training Tulowitzki 5 23 two home run 11 strikeout Yankees Manager Aaron Boone still maintains confidence Tulowitzkis timing come around
Hell get Boone said Im convinced
Tulowitzkis path Yankees connection Jeter Gregorius make long winding story Had Gregoriuss right elbow ligament torn last fall required Tommy John surgery Tulowitzki would Blue Jays released Tulowitzki December several frustrating season Yankees would pursued option trade freeagent market leaned heavily Gleyber Torres Yankees second baseman last year shortstop
But ligament tear Toronto release nearly decade Cashman said Tulowitzkis name Jeters face Tulowitzki
I want respectful honest relationship player Cashman said adding later The answer I provided back answer If access everything could anything question Its disrespectful But time Troy well recognized best shortstop game
That case offseason Soon Blue Jays released Tulowitzki 38 million remaining contract Tulowitzkis agent Paul Cohen arranged workout Dec 18 It Long Beach State Tulowitzki starred dozen team attended including Yankees
Video session captivated Cashman called Cohen request additional private workout Three day later Tulowitzki Yankees list preferred team taking ground ball front two top Yankees scout The entire front office later viewed extensive video healthy Tulowitzki moving ease
After Cashman said
But competition Because 40game suspension shortstop Addison Russell Chicago Cubs aggressively pursued Tulowitzki So Los Angeles Angels liked Tulowitzki third base Others eyed Tulowitzki second
Ultimately even though Gregorius expected return point summer Tulowitzki chose Yankees
Ive done lot thing career Ive close havent ring said Tulowitzki played playoff four time including 2007 World Series sweep Boston Red Sox It strictly Thats Im excited
The negotiation easy Because Blue Jays hook Tulowitzkis million Yankees needed offer major league minimum 555000 All Tulowitzki wanted top notrade clause unusual oneyear deal amount
I want whole time said
The Yankees eased Tulowitzki spring training regular day week leg plan regular season Torres play shortstop day And whenever Gregorius return Yankees juggle
He look like he athletic Yankees infielder DJ LeMahieu said Tulowitzki also teammate Colorado He look really good
Tulowitzki undoubtedly motivated prove Blue Jays wrong well thought would never play injury He said wanted show older player could overcome hard time still contribute
But guided anything long repetitive day rehabilitation 5yearold son Taz remember seeing father play major league two year ago
To get back see I thought every day Tulowitzki said
Beginning March 28 Tulowitzki chance When growing California Tulowitzki watched Yankees later wore No 2 jersey deep admiration player feel relevant Jeter

She found partner Aaron Boone would playfully shriek oh God light go Im freaking
Of course wasnt freaking Mendoza also working Mets special adviser said last summer The one freaking But totally made laugh calmed
That calm collected attitude precisely landed Boone job Joe Girardis replacement last year put test Yankees stagger first week General Manager Brian Cashman saw Boone certain trait believed Girardi lacked notably ability connect younger Yankees difficult time
In 16 month job Boone brought clubhouse unity thats impossible miss He make point chatting oneonone player daily basis either clubhouse outfield batting practice The conversation brief sometimes longer second Boone successfully opened channel previously closed Yankees
Boonie definitely care u Aaron Judge said He make easy play know he corner
And quality Boones crucial team confronted setback setback far Even slew injury sabotaged Yankees never expected drop four first six game weaker opponent like Baltimore Orioles Detroit Tigers Aprils schedule fact supposed clear path Yankees sprint top American League East 23 first 28 game team finished 500 2018

Of course bigleague manager expected preach optimism Boones decidedly lowkey nature set apart Unlike Girardi never quite seemed ease Boone exudes calm postgame news conference While acknowledging Yankees woeful start Wednesday nevertheless said Ill hang hat group know well fight way get rolling
The mantra reflects Boones innate sunniness also underlying shift role major league manager The job longer prioritizes strategy dugout The era making move based hunch long gone analytics department already determined probability success every decision leaving manager ability motivate connect player top priority
That changing dynamic explains Yankees replaced Girardi taken within game World Series 2017 After 10 year manager Girardi stunned dismissal Yankees official convinced change order prepared dismiss even championship season
Cashman already looking someone younger open better quantitative analysis As part daylong interview club Boone presented sheet paper 2018 season stats nine Yankees starter without name attached Boone told construct batting order based number alone He aced test Boones 1through9 lineup matched analyst Like everyone else organization met Boone day team statistician gave enthusiastic thumbsup
A year later team stumbled early test It course much soon say Yankees panicking As first baseman Luke Voit observed Tuesday night still super early But perfect time Boones Zen As Yankees left town subdued mood expression manager face still said What worry

Keeping Score
The Orioles first baseman 0 last 49 Why still lineup A Nobel Prizewinning economist explains flawed logic behind letting Daviss contract dictate playing time
By Benjamin Hoffman
On Sept 14 2018 Chris Davis hitless last 17 atbats got 21 changeup White Sox pitcher James Shields jumped Davis lined ball shift right field hustling way second double
Since day Davis 33yearold slugger Baltimore Orioles hit 53 home run season known nothing ignominy He went hitless final 21 atbats 2018 season clinching worst batting average qualified player major league history 168
On Monday made another dark entry record book After 0for5 performance Baltimores 124 win Oakland reached 49 consecutive atbats without hit breaking previous record 46 set Eugenio Velez across 2010 2011 season
The extraordinary run futility raise obvious question Why Orioles still putting Davis field When reporter asked exactly Mondays game Manager Brandon Hyde said He really wanted play today
In truth decision keep playing Davis almost certainly 17 million salary year 93 million Orioles owe beyond 2019 salary deferred payment team sending paycheck 2037 season Considering amount money team committed Davis situation might le suited manager like Hyde someone like Richard Thaler Nobel Prizewinning economist University Chicagos Booth School Business
To Thaler Orioless refusal sideline Davis classic example sunk cost fallacy economic principle detailed book Misbehaving The Making Behavioral Economics
A classic example order dessert restaurant cost 15 Thaler said phone interview You take couple bite realize already full dessert really rich feel like cant waste whole thing So eat
Ideally Thaler said correct decision ignore cost already paid evaluate situation strictly merit One favorite illustration sunk cost said deciding whether attend basketball game purchased ticket even though attending would mean traveling blizzard
The mistake people make thinking somehow using player eating dessert going game getting money back said Its Its making feel little better purchase turned good one
If Orioles waiting Davis pull tailspin ignoring fact player typically physical peak around 27 year old Daviss age 2013 53homer season inspired 161 million contract generally see decline performance In Daviss case immediate dip 2014 brief resurgence 2015 threeplus season since hit 199 1520 atbats onbase plus slugging percentage 684 adjusted home park 15 percent worse league average period
Unlike Velez previous record holder Bill Bergen 1909 Dave Campbell 1973 Craig Counsell 2011 0for45 streak Davis staying lineup glove He rated belowaverage fielder Sports Info Solutions previous two season meaning make living almost entirely bat And yet In last 56 plate appearance total offensive output consisted six walk two RBI 27 strikeout
Davis occasionally booed Baltimore season received mostly encouragement 6585 fan Camden Yards Monday number also set team record futility aside game 2015 fan admitted Hyde also continued look silver lining matter cloudy thing get
He hit three ball nose told reporter Mondays game though none contact resulted hit So Im taking positive moving forward Hopefully good start
Thaler channeling statistician Bill James correctly guessed Davis worth around minus3 win replacement last two year Baseball Reference minus28 last season yet release 2019 number That figure compound cost alreadybad deal Davis negative value taking roster spot playing time could given lowcost player minor league
Thaler acknowledged concept sunkcost fallacy easy one people comprehend many still convince ignore reality face hard decision push forward despite cost
In case sport team management may think suppose cut theyre going look like idiot said Of course whats true playing make look like bigger idiot
Thaler said believed owner would congratulate general manager willing admit mistake move along bad deal
Barring said Daviss example could used team better understand approach large deal future If team one keep player field matter team avoid longterm deal But said owner willing spend money well eat cost thing go south could rewarded would offer potential benefit without later compounding error
Davis play Tuesdays 132 loss Athletics Thaler belief team best bet moving forward go one step benching The team cut Davis replace minor leaguer even socalled replacement near average player would represent significant improvement
They could win let say two three game year cost half million said That would cheapest two three win could possibly buy That would like adding star

Luis Severino 25 staff ace able throw mound try recover rotator cuff inflammation right shoulder
After long toss flat ground team spring training facility Tampa Fla weekend Severino didnt feel great recent toss Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said Monday night team 43 loss Houston Astros
Severino sent New York evaluated Christopher Ahmad team head doctor Boone said Severino expected magnetic resonance imaging examination Tuesday perhaps test
Boone said Severinos shoulder felt OK want And Yankees 55 unsure pitcher shoulder hasnt felt ready get mound next step throwing program Severino last threw 130 foot flat ground
Im hoping able get hump quite yet Boone said
The original testing led u pretty confident added But weve got make sure he right The fact hasnt graduated flat ground throwing yet mound weve got try answer question best
Severino one Yankees majorleagueleading 11 player injured list The Yankees nearly 87 million 2019 salary IL includes star like outfielder Giancarlo Stanton reliever Dellin Betances standouts outfielder Aaron Hicks starter pitcher C C Sabathia expected return weekend
Before Severino IL since May 2016 strained right triceps
Severino since March 5 scratched first spring training start discomfort throwing shoulder An MRI exam revealed rotator cuff inflammation according Yankees Severino received prescription injection antiinflammatory medication rest
In order complete fouryear 40 million contract extension February Severino passed physical included MRI exam
Severino originally expected back injury sometime May Until latest test done unclear whether estimate change
The Yankees ill afford lose Severino twotime AllStar one best starter American League significant period time But rotation managed without far

Miguel Andujar Yankees third baseman listened gently phrased question injured right shoulder possibility seasonending surgery He acknowledged cold truth torn labra They cant heal player suffer similar rupture end operating table
Yes Andujar said get But spoke Yankees 31 loss Detroit Tigers Tuesday Andujar dismissed worstcase scenario vowing beat odds avoid surgery return action within week
If would rare instance good fortune Yankees eight player 10day Injured List including ace Luis Severino circus strong man home run leader Giancarlo Stanton frontline shortstop Didi Gregorius Andujar joined headfirst dive third base Orioles Sunday
After initially feeling weird sensation shoulder Andujar said remained game still felt strong afterward even Monday But magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed small labral tear prompting Yankees shut Andujar least two week After begin cautious program physical therapy team hope preclude need surgery
Im optimistic Andujar said My shoulder strong Theres still chance I get get back field
Aaron Boone inclined turn gaze away possibility Andujarless summer Hard blame The 24yearold infielder finished second American Leagues rookie year voting 2018 leading firstyear player hit 170 breaking Yankees record double rookie season previously set Joe DiMaggio 1936
Although inconsistent defense committed 15 error last year Andujars performance partly explained Yankees decision pas pursuing Manny Machado free agency winter After losing Red Sox division series Yankees decidedly upbeat Andujar roster general entering 2019
That optimism based three factor Aaron Judge missed seven week broken wrist last summer would healthy 2019 Stanton would better acclimated playing highpressure New York market second year catcher Gary Sanchez nowhere go batting disastrous 186 last season
Bundled continued maturation Andujar fellow rookie Gleyber Torres Yankees felt could close gap Boston without spending much new addition Judge spoke teammate recently said From first day camp I felt going better team last year
But five game harsh reality Yankees yet gain traction season despite starting two lightly regarded opponent Orioles Tigers An unusually severe run injury compounded frustration
Severino received diagnosis shoulder inflammation last month still thrown mound likely return May earliest Center fielder Aaron Hicks battling stubborn lower back problem already received two cortisone shot Dellin Betances flamethrowing reliever sidelined shoulder impingement although threw bullpen session Tuesday could back week
Stantons injury mysterious grade1 strain left biceps sustained Boone called funky swing Sunday Like Andujar Stanton lineup least 10 day although injury le serious Nevertheless Yankees forced depend reinforcement earlier expected putting depth emotional resilience test
The alwaysupbeat Boone said felt Yankees would emerge better team Aprils challenge
One strength organization depth said adding Yankees replacement capable producing big league level
Boones rallying cry might resonated bit Yankees lost opening series Orioles Most damning situational hitting The Yankees went 10 56 runner base threegame series including 6 29 207 men scoring position including eight strikeout
There wasnt much improvement Tuesday Yankees managed six hit Tigers didnt runner scoring position final four inning
Starter Masahiro Tanaka threw effectively 6⅔ inning work undone closer Aroldis Chapman continues lose velocity
As Chapman allowed deciding two run ninth inning oncefeared 100milesperhour fastball ticked low 95
I feel great said despite allowing four seven batter faced reach base dooming Yankees another loss
First baseman Luke Voit asked patience unsettled fan saying Its super early There still 157 game go
But different crew right ship
Without Andujar Stanton callups like Clint Frazier Tyler Wade get chance DJ LeMahieu infielder acquired Yankees January started place Andujar Tuesday
But Yankees Boone insisted expectation changed although one could blame crossing finger tightly

MINNEAPOLIS This Final Four fifth anniversary one effective inadvertent instance athlete activism college sport
This Connecticut star Shabazz Napier speaking news medium shortly 2014 national championship game said sometimes enough eat
There hungry night I go bed Im starving said
Within week NCAAs board director Division I voted lift restriction much team could feed player No longer would bizarre hairsplitting meal notoriously serving peanut count serving peanut butter Now team routinely give athlete feast
This commonsense reform work probably would occurred eventually But stark comment highprofile player NCAAs signature event ensured nearly immediate change boatload attention NCAAs power college athlete
It fruitful remember efficacy Napiers comment moment appears reform college sport muchmaligned policy amateurism come within The player foremost maybe even exclusive power agitate change
What would happened Zion Williamson said Nike shoe exploded jeopardizing career enough enough longer would wear shoe nothing coach least indirectly paid million Nike And player put hypocrisy either
The power labor player said Kain Colter former Northwestern quarterback led unionization drive among teammate several year ago
This obviously displayed 2015 Missouri football player threatened sit game unless university president stepped fired He stepped That boycott concerned campus racial climate rather player compensation ought conceal reality happened The player unpaid ununionized flexed muscle system gave
Vesting power athlete reform sport historically aberrant From Jackie Robinson withstanding taunt threat worse break Major League Baseballs color line baseball player striking 1970s 80 gain keep fullfledged free agency track standout Edwin Moses devising benefit Olympic athlete athlete often one bringing change Their leverage unmatched They one fan pay see therefore one ultimately power profit
And one steady interest well interest
Consider else happened since Napiers comment
Colters unionization effort National Labor Relations Board regional director endorsed week Napiers Final Four squashed overall board
The antitrust lawsuit might allowed player profit use likeness video game medium ended extremely limited victory player
Last month second antitrust suit sought explode NCAAs ban compensation concluded districtcourt level technical victory player looked much like victory establishment A federal judge ruled NCAA could continue limit payment player directly related education
The court forum youre going get relief said Don Yee sport lawyer playersrights advocate
For Yee also happens Tom Bradys agent solution private entrepreneurialism He planning small professional football league would field player yet eligible NFL generally requires player three year removed high school It would developmental like college football unlike college football average pay would 50000
A planned summer basketball league Historical Basketball League would pay scholarship collegelevel player enabling sell name image likeness sponsor The NBAs development league plan offer higher salary The probable dissolution oneanddone rule next year permit talented high school graduate jump straight NBA instead spend least year college
A state notably North Carolina California bill floating around would allow athlete paid say video game us name likeness
All effort well intentioned But past prologue system successfully reformed patchwork fashion
Nor college sport establishment likely change mind volition
At news conference Minneapolis last week NCAA president Mark Emmert said sought increase athlete participation college sport governance
Im lifelong academic said I grew tradition I never worked school didnt student board full voting board member They voted contract I think thats perfectly appropriate
There athlete serving several important council one NCAA Board Governors No athlete vote Emmerts contract extended late last year 2023
Tim Nevius onetime NCAA investigator whose experience led turn system belief answer lie player activism Last month announced new organization College Athlete Advocacy Initiative plan pair business representing athlete NCAA trying advocate broader reform coordination player
He acknowledged interview challenge including relatively short time span college athlete actually college athlete well current lack formal bargaining power But insisted player action surest avenue change
There power athlete said simply realize help take power hand
Ros GoldUnwude Turner Sports analyst former Stanford basketball player said last month expected hear college athlete felt position pecking order
Thats way culture telling story social medium platform said
If youre really struggling hungry added experience come
Apathy come well though Beyond structural obstacle athlete deciding system unfair determining act change player could validly decide happy receiving currently get
Napier reserve Nets spokesman declined comment article said hungry night speech heard round world even though received le publicity
He noted wrong Players jersey sold fan player receive cut More basically said player paid
It suggested wrong Probably
Something change something change Napier said five year ago But doesnt end day weve long

Obamacare need work The original plan mooshedup compromise insurance company Trump sabotaging whenever possible But still provides coverage 20 million Americans And evidence even red state average people want see go away In last election voter Utah Idaho Nebraska supported expanding state program
Pelosi already pushing bill would put cap much premium could cost Obamacare customer well protecting popular coverage like prescription drug maternity care
Itll never become law Trump office But Republicans try argue bill theyll reminded approximately every three second party alternative dump whole program favor new plan yet named Or written Or discussed Or given hashtag
So got president
Maybe somebody trying divert another attack John McCain Donald nobody defame dead war hero like But dont take break suggest something new
Maybe Trump bored The right intended follow happy news Mueller report demand new investigation Bill Hillary Clinton For America thats exciting prospect bringing back Duck Dynasty
Even everybody Mike Pence janitor allegedly urging president stay away health care cost plenty people egg

He doesnt deserve blame specific attack He deserve blame increase whitenationalist violence
By David Leonhardt
Opinion Columnist
The president United States suggested last week political supporter might resort violence didnt get way
The statement didnt even get much attention Im guessing heard lot collegeadmissions scandal president threat extralegal violence So let tell little threat
In Oval Office interview writer rightwing news site Breitbart President Trump began complaining Paul Ryan As speaker House Ryan blocked effort House Republicans subpoena investigate people political left Trumps loyal ally House wanted go tougher Trump said werent allowed leadership
To Trump incident part larger problem You know left play tougher game Its funny I actually think people right tougher dont play tougher OK I tell I support police support military support Bikers Trump I tough people dont play tough go certain point would bad bad
Sign David Leonhardts daily newsletter commentary news reading suggestion around web
This wasnt first time Trump mused violence course He talked Second Amendment people preventing appointment liberal judge Hes encouraged police officer bang suspect head car roof He suggested supporter knock hell heckler At rally shortly 2018 Election Day went similar riff Bikers Trump military
Im well aware various seenoevil attempt excuse behavior Thats talk Dont take literally Other Republicans keeping check His speech tweet dont really matter
But matter The president continued encouragement violence white nationalism part reason whitenationalist violence increasing Funny work
After Trumps latest threat I reached several expert democracy authoritarianism ask made Their answer consistent No United States appear risk widespread political violence anytime soon But Trumps word still corroding democracy public safety
His latest incitement fit historical pattern one scary echo Daniel Ziblatt cowrote recent book How Democracies Die told Trump combined lie political opponent Democrats need investigated madeup scandal allusion patriotic violent response ordinary citizen Latin American autocrat including Hugo Chávez Venezuela used combination So European fascist 1930s
The United States thank goodness armed citizen militia carrying regular attack country But situation still worrisome Violent talk minimum encourage lonewolf violence Steven Levitsky Ziblatts coauthor Harvard political scientist said It also slowly normalize political violence turning discourse idea unsayable even unthinkable thing sayable thinkable
These risk hypothetical In 2017 House candidate bodyslammed reporter asked probing question behavior recent precedent Trump praised nowcongressman Greg Gianforte assault In Bright Light Watch survey political scientist late last year 49 percent said United States tolerate political violence notable decline earlier level Some respondent cited Gianforte
Statistics hate crime notoriously unreliable evidence strongly suggests theyre rising The FBIs data show increase The AntiDefamation League report 73 percent rise extremistrelated killing last four year
Not attack come people identify political right obviously The 2017 attempted mass murder House Republicans baseball field one horrific example But politically motivated attack indeed come right Last year 39 50 extremist killing tracked ADL committed white supremacist another eight committed killer espousing antigovernment view
Drawing direct line purveyor hateful rhetoric specific hate crime usually impossible And usually mistake try The motive crime New Zealand last week Pittsburgh last year typically stew mental illness personal anger mixedup ideology Trump doesnt deserve blamed specific crime But deserve blame trend
It isnt complicated The man world largest bully pulpit keep encouraging violence white nationalism Lo behold whitenationalist violence rise You work pretty hard persuade thats big coincidence

I small piece search find cure Now I feel Im getting erased medical science doesnt answer
By Phillip S Gutis
I knew participating clinical trial Alzheimers drug unlikely help But gave hope
So news broke week drug company Biogen canceled oncepromising trial disappointing result I felt like Id punched stomach
It difficult week already The night Biogen canceled trial I realized I losing 12 year memory cherished dog Abe died kidney disease last year There image brain photograph I lay bed digging frantically memory came empty
This disease bad I feel Im getting erased medical science doesnt answer
My phone began ring followed Facebook message Did see news today
Biogen research partner Eisai canceled trial independent review data determined drug unlikely help Alzheimers patient compared placebo This disappointing news confirms complexity treating Alzheimers disease need advance knowledge neuroscience Michel Vounatsos Biogens chief executive said statement We incredibly grateful Alzheimers disease patient family investigator participated trial contributed greatly research
I deeply disappointed overwhelmingly grateful Biogen company scientist working feverishly find treatment cure Alzheimers
I received diagnosis earlyonset Alzheimers three year ago I responded ad Biogen trial seeking people experiencing memory issue Despite surface assessment trial coordinator I seemed fine I scored low enough day memory testing told something indeed likely wrong Subsequent MRIs PET scan confirmed age 54 I indeed earlyonset Alzheimers
I joined clinical trial three year since diagnosis I received 35 monthly infusion The first 20 month considered blind phase I could received placebo trial drug The last 15 month Ive open label phase mean I definitely receiving drug known aducanumab
Aducanumab target protein known beta amyloid hallmark Alzheimers disease brain Scientists believe amyloid buildup one potential cause Alzheimers far drug designed remove failed slow course disease Earlier year Roche canceled trial similar drug crenezumab likewise designed target beta amyloid buildup
The handwriting wall aducanumab Roche made announcement In fact 2018 Eli Lilly AstraZeneca Pfizer Merck canceled research dementia therapy
Even though day seemed numbered I continued participate aducanumab trial In 2019 alone Ive trudged Memory Center University Pennsylvania seven time infusion MRI PET scan testing
Why put I knew heart drug wasnt going stop Alzheimers progression I truly believed I small piece search find cure
Over last three year I learned difficult becoming researcher find people participate drug trial Last year The Times reported finding patient test new Alzheimers treatment becoming insurmountable obstacle
I decided Id singlehandedly take issue I started I called shoechallenge For infusion test Id wear different pair silly shoe post Facebook It way get people attention encourage participate drug trial
Over last year Ive worn Hobbit slipper elf shoe fish flipflops many others I enjoyed picking next pair crazy shoe wear infusion deck SpongeBob unicorn slipper I working nerve wear pair stiletto one month visit ala wont happen
I miss shoe challenge time trial In addition trying help find treatment participating trial gave something appointment calendar hour house
Alzheimers steal memory It also take away ability participate much life hold job comfortable loud restaurant movie many social situation
I lost job nearby small nonprofit late last year day pretty empty I exercise nearby indoor rowing studio virtually every day sometimes twice day I go store run local errand I doctor appointment Otherwise though Im pretty cut As one therapist noted definitely I anticipated spending late 50
My life marked hard work first The New York Times starting copy boy school climbing clerical rank I became reporter trainee reporter After I became advocate landed job American Civil Liberties Union I became communication director Natural Resources Defense Council staff dozen spread around world
For diagnosis I able continue work But I started losing detail struggling complete assignment Today working day Im looking volunteer opportunity I officially retired Earlier year I qualified Social Security disability begin receiving monthly check soon
So Alzheimers Ill look another trial likely least year I participate another medication trial
In meantime Ill continue Alzheimers advocacy Im headed Washington week participate Alzheimers Associations annual advocacy forum And coincidentally day Biogen news broke I scheduled meeting constituent service director Representative Brian Fitzpatrick member Congress I told story drug trial canceled thanked congressman team support additional funding Alzheimers research
My basic message today long I communicate We give When Hall Fame baseball great Tom Seaver announced recently leaving public life dementia I saw powerful message Alzheimers forum
Whenever celebrity diagnosed dementia make news sad However every person US made news given dementia diagnosis That would additional 1329 announcement every single day And even sadder

On Comedy
By Jason Zinoman
If Dave Attell ever retires periodically hinted year become club comedy
Comics still work club course But era savvy career move diversify podcasts video playing variety room Attell 54 rare elite standup advertises mixture pride selfdeprecation simply club comic More important No one alive make better argument aesthetic New York club comedy tussling crowd work quick setup ruthless punch line go gut
For 32 year performed nearly every night week making longerrunning fixture city The Phantom Opera one aged better although might know first glance
On cold weeknight month Comedy Cellar often appears late show walked onstage looking rumpled sporting baggy winter coat headwear situation resembled Russian nesting doll After removing hoodie covered customary black baseball cap took reveal yet another hat began set knowing quip I look like I came get warm
Attell describing like decade I gym building said 1996 HBO halfhour Does anyone else live Y
Attell actually successful showbiz career includes host cult show Comedy Central Insomniac Showtime Daves Old Porn along brief stint The Daily Show Saturday Night Live But he revered peer public He never put special frequently could His easygoing double act Bumping Mics Jeff Ross debuted last fall Netflix first release since 2014
What Attell best doesnt lead fame fortune day Its he oldschool performer medium landscape biased toward novelty provocation Making noise crowded comedy scene today mean going personal political controversial Attell generally avoids three You watch hour learn next nothing life deepest conviction outside abiding faith punchy joke
He one quickest mind comedy gently insulting audience critical act adding tension unpredictability change pace At terrific 90minute show December Carolines I sat front row treated like speed bag jabbing punch line glass Isaac Asimovs grandson posture Stephen Hawkings stunt double snackfood preference When I said rice cracker responded Whats favorite porn homework
At core Attell highoctane nofrills joke machine delivery system punch line improvised vast majority rigorously honed With compulsive work ethic test joke year tweaking word repeatedly find funniest sound He doesnt add many actouts sell line weave bit story build comic momentum If transcribe joke read aloud flatly remain funny
His comedy doesnt carry message specific mood texture shifted year He built reputation dirty dissolute image focusing sex toy drinking ornate literary description testicle My favorite might compared tent one know fold
If listen closely 2014 Comedy Central special Road Work hear root buttonpushing humor Louis CK albeit quicker form Ever bunch mushroom think youre pillow fight turn live baby go one joke
Attell isnt raunchy As gotten older added joke food pet He still predict night might end audience member based theyre drinking he sober arent many punch line Jägermeister
He night crowd work tentative Jeff Ross good match prodding take risk But moment I see Attell perform I think entering prime something famously selfcritical comic would probably disagree
Stick around long enough acquire certain gravitas matter ragged unpretentious may Attell far wedded economical structure hard joke veer poetic flourish Dave Chappelle seems little interest waging culture war
But see perform enough theme emerges close attention paid lonely overlooked figure society particularly unforgiving city He wonderful bit imagining guy sell fruit Sixth Avenue 4 another extended metaphor picture carrying lantern thick fog saying fog thing like Friend foe
His material landscape Tom Waits song crusty cynical inspiring bleak laughter sound might turn cough moment Attell built comic world perfectly fit character long played onstage one past plumb extra laugh
Around midnight Comedy Cellar another night month Attell invited audience imagine loneliness worker making Subway sandwich empty restaurant After setting scene economically I waiting food describes watching employee deciding make smallest dream come true
With conspiratorial glance one side said Take glove Then hit audience two punch line instructing sad sack live best life Raw dog Put mayonnaise wherever want
Like New York Dave Attell dirty used still make joke cold cut sound deliriously filthy

Before post baby bump college acceptance letter online remember much fun used share person
By KJ DellAntonia
Ms DellAntonia novelist writes frequently parenthood
My kid good news lately Academic triumph hockey tournament win even little college admission excitement Theyve rough moment bittersweet one There last game disappointment unwashed dish galore If youre friend even somebody know mom struck friendly conversation line grocery store Id love talk I might even show picture
But Im going post social medium Because I tried I came simple conclusion getting reaction friend family acquaintance via emojis exclamation point rather hug actual exclamation
Its fun And I dont want
Im one pulling back social medium While around twothirds American adult use Facebook way many u use shifted recent year About 40 percent adult user report taking break checking Facebook several week 26 percent tell researcher theyve deleted app phone point past year
Some changed behavior Facebooks lax record protecting user data More half adult user adjusted privacy setting past year Others seem concerned platform make act feel Either way pulling back social medium way embrace family privacy
I definitely seen evolution toward sharing le said Julianna Miner adjunct professor global community health George Mason University author forthcoming Raising ScreenSmart Kid Embrace Good Avoid Bad Digital Age She added Its hard tell change response security breach result people getting tired
Even Mark Zuckerberg chief executive Facebook seems suspect least part latter experimenting living life larger online sphere decade many u ready return intimate group human long thrived In recent blog post Mr Zuckerberg announced plan emphasize private conversation smaller community platform Interacting Facebook wrote become fundamentally private experience le town square living room
As technology advance continue blur line public private Sign Charlie Warzels limitedrun newsletter explore whats stake
Thats shift Ive already made since I find asking I embraced personal soapbox online square first place The I reserve good news personal challenge sharing directly friend I see digital world never offered satisfaction support Instead I lost moment seeing friend face light joyful news frequently found wishing everyone within network privy rant disappointment
Theres plenty evidence interpersonal facetoface interaction yield stronger neural response anything online said Ms Miner Online empathy worth something u much It take something like six virtual hug equal one real hug
Time spent seeking virtual hug take u outside world living draw u back phone course reason many network offer burst feedback first place
Ultimately youre giving social medium time take post said Stacey Steinberg associate director Center Children Families University Florida Levin College Law author paper topic called Sharenting Childrens Privacy Age Social Media

Bella Alarie become mustsee player Princeton woman basketball team Its something coach Courtney Banghart known rest world finding
Banghart began sense people becoming aware star player recent conversation Chris Young former major league pitcher played basketball baseball Princeton
He go Id pay watch two player college basketball Zion Williamson Bella Alarie Banghart said
Almost every basketball fan know Williamson Dukes top player probably NBAs next top draft pick But Alarie She 6foot4 junior developed player capable lifting Tigers national prominence On Saturday Cornell semifinal Ivy League tournament grabbed eight rebound scored gamehigh 21 point shooting 9 10 field 6847 victory advance final
Observers believe chance something Ivy League player done since Allison Feaster graduated Harvard 1998 represent conference extended WNBA career
This development le dedicated plan series serendipitous choice merged hard work Alarie multitalented twoway player kind sought professional level tower peer growing She remembers bit taller say recall time basketball hand
Her father Mark former Duke NBA player set making sure could play position
I think lot really focusing guard skill Bella Alarie said I think dad knew young age developing skill early would really benefit long run We didnt really know tall I would Im really lucky I kept growing
Her slight build meant high school career National Cathedral School Washington drew interest Ivy League team including Harvard Penn get much letter interest father alma mater Anything beyond playing college radar arrived Princeton
In high school I never really thought someone would achieve thing I far college Alarie said And I getting recruited I really want put emphasis getting really wellrounded college experience The Ivy League I really drawn beginning Princeton Penn Harvard definitely school came
Things began change Alarie Ivy League freshman year honor selected play USA Basketball under19 FIBA World Cup
To make team really proved I could compete best country Alarie said And best world age So I think summer really boosted confidence player also expanded game I learned play another system
Her coach took note turned Alarie true hybrid She used post adding 20 pound frame without forsaking guard skill That make intriguing pro prospect league dominated player like Elena Delle Donne Breanna Stewart size ability play position
Opposing coach noticed
I love Tony Bozzella Seton Hall coach said Alarie 22 point 12 rebound last year Princeton win Seton Hall Reminds Delle Donne Not good yet similar game Obviously great scorer many way awesome rebounder passer great vision supersmart A definite firstround pick
This season missing Princetons first nine game broken arm Alarie putting number seldom seen school She set Ivy Leagues singlegame scoring mark last month 45point outing Columbia process became Princeton player Bill Bradley score least 45
Entering weekend Ivy League tournament Yale Alarie averaging 230 point 107 rebound game shooting 51 percent field range extending beyond arc
On defensive end according Synergy Sports data allowing opponent 0564 point per possession ranked 36th country among 2231 Division I player least 100 defensive possession
Accordingly Princeton 27 without Entering weekend Tigers 202 Alarie Unfortunately opponent broke right arm spent recovery time working aggressively going left making even harder stop
While WNBA team comment Alarie publicly scout executive tracking As one put Shes radar They let coach know
I talk WNBA coach time Banghart said So certainly shes secret WNBA
Princetons program generated pro talent Blake Dietrick Ivy League player year 201415 went play Atlanta Dream last season Leslie Robinson whose father Craig twotime player year Princeton early 1980s drafted Liberty third round last season WNBA draft
Dietrick credited success program whole I would nearly much WNBA interest success team 300 season said referring Princetons regularseason record 201415 But also credited coach working improve player within team context eye longterm success
To Banghart different way would treat highachieving Princeton student
If someone interested finance I connect people think learn Banghart said With Bella thing The positionless better Theres eye helping Princeton there eye best pro chooses So Im thinking big picture deserves Shes earned

ALGONA Iowa For nearly two decade Representative Steve King pummeled Republican primary challenger dispatched Democrats even former Iowa governor wife glided victory conservative district He spent little energy fundraising put control racist language made little effort hold town hall constituent
Then November reelected 10000 vote called nastiest dishonest political gauntlet Iowan put two month later stripped committee assignment rebuked House comment seemed endorse white supremacy Now nineterm Iowa Republican attack left right
Far folding though Mr King returning basic reasserting aggressive presence northwestern Iowa district scheduling event every county holding many three town hall week constituent pack linger take photo shake hand
This really important part civic activity Mr King told constituent crowded room library Algona northern town 5000 We always done havent always told
The wind shifted even Republicans concede
Things different theyve said Craig Robinson former political director Republican Party Iowa Steve King good long A lot eye opened saw close came losing seat last election cycle
Hoping win prominent conservative tired putting Mr Kings fire three Republicans widely considered serious challenger Mr King faced year already pledged run 2020 primary race including assistant majority leader Iowa State Senate Randy Feenstra represents one conservative swath district
The campaign arm House Democrats also put target back state Democratic Party deployed organizer set ground game next year earliest Democrats ever begun effort district backed President Trump nearly 30 percentage point
We see held accountable We really put spotlight something overlooked long time said J D Scholten Democrat lost Mr King November Youre seeing reaction thing hasnt held check year
Regardless scrutiny Steve King Steve King Last week declined answer question town hall asking whether white society superior nonwhite society query hypothetical At another town hall last week complained Hurricane Katrina victim mostly black asked help neighbor Iowans take care
The Cedar Rapids Gazette issued scathing editorial accusing Mr King choosing embarrass Iowans inflammatory rhetoric
For many western Iowans thats part appeal
Hes straight talker said Art Cullen Pulitzer Prizewinning editor Mr Kings hometown newspaper The Storm Lake Times He aint afraid man He aint afraid system Thats powerful
The system clearly House Republican leader removed Mr King committee assignment January comment made The New York Times questioning white supremacist considered offensive A number powerful party leader including Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky majority leader Representative Liz Cheney Wyoming No 3 House Republican suggested resign House overwhelmingly passed resolution disapproving Mr Kings statement
Even October head House Republican campaign arm time Representative Steve Stivers Ohio jettisoned Mr King week election declaring We must stand white supremacy hate form
Mr King long made remark denigrating immigrant long overlooked Republican presidential candidate genuflected toward kingmaker critical Iowa caucus Republican House leader ducked dodged rather answer Mr King enmeshed one scandal another retweeting Nazi sympathizer saying young unauthorized immigrant calf size cantaloupe theyre hauling 75 pound marijuana across desert displaying Confederate flag adopting white nationalist language cant restore civilization somebody el baby
But close race November signaled member party voter patience may wearing thin Mr Feenstra announced primary challenge day Mr Kings incendiary comment white supremacy published raised 100000 next 10 day according The Des Moines Register
Today Iowas Fourth District doesnt voice Washington current representative caustic nature left u without seat table Mr Feenstra said January
Mr Kings younger son spokesman Jeff King quick fire back telling The Register Mr Feenstras challenge amounted misguided political opportunism fueled establishment puppeteer lie left

Most player chance making stardom slim many challenging break even financially paying travel training expense That ITF commissioning extensive study declared old structure unsustainable Too many marginal player basically masquerading professional
The ITFs mission promote tennis around world organization work ensure tournament continent But event open comer included player little hope breaking top tier 50 year old The ITF study determined one year many 6000 socalled professional player earn even 1 A recent independent investigation also found tsunami fixed match lower level player earning little prize money vulnerable betting syndicate

Swihart firstround draft choice eight year ago never quite reached potential Boston Mookie Betts Red Sox fifthround pick draft Most Valuable Player Award American League last season
The first day I stepped Red Sox back 2011 Betts said Tuesday night another dreary day defending World Series champion Weve tight ever since Its definitely tough But Im kind happy new beginning
The Red Sox could use new beginning They dropped 12 first 18 game latest 80 loss featuring masterpiece Yankees James Paxton Tuesday The Red Sox started badly since 1996 Roger Clemenss last season Fenway Park
As hardthrowing strikeout artist Sale heir Clemens Pedro Martinez He filled role well Boston gave fiveyear 145 million contract extension March 2024
Sale 30 1803 career strikeout pitcher 1500 inning threshold crossed bottom fifth Tuesday But point Yankees already scored four run big hit fastball DJ LeMahieu changeup Clint Frazier slider Mike Tauchman
Sale lost four start season 850 ERA His fastball harder slider sharper Tuesday would accept positive feedback five mostly lackluster inning He could remember ever pitching poorly said
Im going sugarcoat I flatout stink right Sale said adding later This flatout embarrassing family team fan This bad get I pitch better
So teammate Bostons starter 718 ERA highest major part teamwide slump despite significant injury unlike Yankees 12 player injured list
Were healthy playing good baseball Red Sox Manager Alex Cora said Weve inconsistent every aspect game pitching offense defense base running Its u clean start playing better
When one best team big league best But time right We know know way weve playing know thing get better And pretty simple Get better everything
The Yankees 79 Tuesday marked first time since 1992 rival played least 15 game season 500 But game Yankees best season contribution plate field Frazier Tauchman Gio Urshela reinforcement wounded
Got roll Manager Aaron Boone said Im sure guy little sick saying Next man truly case
Paxton arrived offseason trade Seattle supposed headliner Tuesday It best performance career last major leaguer throw completegame nohitter Mariners last May close eight shutout inning two hit 12 strikeout walk hit batter
The last Yankee fire eight scoreless inning least 12 strikeout Boston Hall Famer Mike Mussina nearperfect game Sept 2 2001
Throwing lot strike keeping middle plate even he got good life fastball said Betts struck looking 97 milesperhour heat start game He pitched amazing game
Betts hitting 212 part Bostons meager 229 team average worse every major league team final average 2018 That underscore moderating effect long season reason think healthy Red Sox roster continue struggle
But bigger problem Red Sox strength top competition Even without Luis Severino Yankees contend rotation Paxton JA Happ Masahiro Tanaka CC Sabathia Domingo German remains relatively solid And Tampa Bay Rays real major leaguebest 134 record best pitching staff major
The Red Sox look inward They concern Yankees Rays anyone else
If play well well worry thing said Dave Dombrowski Bostons president baseball operation But play way playing wont really make much difference

At event San Juan PR last year unveiling memorial Clemente Gov Ricardo A Rosselló Puerto Rico asked Commissioner Rob Manfred also attendance remove No 21 commission
His body work speaks volume I think Jackie Robinson represents greatness baseball much Roberto Clemente particularly Latinos world Rosselló said afterward So I think right time retire No 21
Manfred resisted idea saying iconic player recognized distinctive way repeatedly pointed prestigious Roberto Clemente Award given annually player embodies sportsmanship community service MLBs way honoring Clemente Manfred called award truly baseball highest honor
With without official directive many Puerto Rican player essentially tried retire number passing chance use No 21 throughout life Clementes major league team Pirates retired No 21

PORT ST LUCIE Fla Jeff McNeil Met mitt clubhouse locker encouraged reorganize stall spring training He rotating third base left field depending day batting anywhere leadoff eighth thirdbase coach Gary DiSarcina sat explained needed eliminate clutter
McNeil proceeded pull eight glove locker pile floor The last one retrieved worn
Thats gamer said
McNeil 27 Mets valuable grinder His blond goatee whisker notable nimbleness earned nickname Squirrel day diving line drive outfielder Long Beach State continued pounce opportunity
In first major league atbat last summer swung first pitch saw base hit center field kept connecting knobless bat ever since pulling double right field smacking ball left shift stroke considers product golfing past On Saturday night Atlanta Braves set new Mets record 90 hit first 76 game major
Before go bat I love telling Go get squirrelly u real quick first baseman Dominic Smith said Squirrel hit best hit
Squirrel fielding however adventure One afternoon early spring training manning left field tried track line drive Miamis Isaac Galloway McNeil wearing shade still reorienting position playing second third last season backpedaled wind blew ball right shoulder He turned way around time ball hit palm glove It popped McNeil crashed warningtrack dirt
Did athletic thing I could said McNeil continues take extra repetition outfield game work route running qualitycontrol coach Luis Rojas serving tutor I make catch almost every time
McNeil make misstep field extraordinary resourcefulness proved indispensable Mets thus far For talk depth Mets found relying heavily McNeil since infielder Todd Frazier Jed Lowrie went injury spring training Neither played season
And McNeil managed consistently middle action early part season whether stroking 400foot triple collecting four hit game hit pitch three time two day caught rundown twice time made two three out inning In essence McNeil thrilling little maddening
I think baseball kind coming back around guy right fielder Michael Conforto said teammate Its much guy launch ball I think seeing team value guy play lot position little thing right Steal base play defense spray ball field
With uncommon handeye coordination plate McNeils offense ultimately reason Manager Mickey Callaway must find place play Though appear offbalance batter box time McNeil patiently keep hand back wait breaking ball To Callaway McNeils approach rank somewhere swing spectrum Wade Boggs Ichiro Suzuki
And matter happens plate teammate coach eagerly await McNeils review atbats
As Conforto said If pitcher get something come back say Im going get guy If throw pitch Im going get Just constantly overflowing confidence
It batting allowed finally break Selected 12th round 2013 draft McNeil languished minor ripping Class AA AAA last season combined 342 average 19 home run 36 walk 71 RBI He continued Mets called stitching together 11game hitting streak one stretch batting 329 225 atbats three homer six triple 19 RBI In lost season Mets McNeil advanced rookie age 26 something revelation
The Mets appreciated McNeils ability enough keep winter trade brought closer Edwin Diaz second baseman Robinson Cano Seattle Queens But acquisition Cano December Lowrie January also meant McNeil needed expand versatility
In spring training McNeil also bulked 195 pound slated take 80 percent assignment left field Lowrie went knee injury first week Frazier slated third base followed oblique strain McNeil moved third picking grounder talking positioning Frazier played every spot major except pitcher catcher center field
He going hit way lineup Frazier said You get leg position lot different movement everywhere go
McNeil figure His unconventional path Mets included playing baseball youth giving golf got high school He eventually competed Jordan Spieth threetime winner major golf tournament United States Junior Amateur Championship July 2009 Spieth tournament McNeil still wonder might ended putted better
Who know Id said
Troy Buckley baseball coach Long Beach State ultimate beneficiary McNeils transition back baseball Unable secure golf scholarship McNeil played baseball California Wahoos scout league junior year high school committed California State University Northridge even suiting Nipomo High senior But Northridge coaching staff fired McNeil ever made campus In turn Northridge recommended McNeil Buckley watched play one weekend offered scholarship McNeil Long Beach State Dirtbag
He pencilthin neck buck teeth diet composed Mountain Dew CheezIts Buckley said But Id ask play third would say yes ever taking grounder
If Buckley hole McNeil weighed 160 pound back filled He started college career splitting time second left Then added center field right field shortstop After drafted Mets injury slowed progress There double sport hernia torn hip labrum followed torn quadriceps
The Mets finally took measure last spring He skinny minor leaguer taking repetition infielder
I like Squirrel Callaway said He raked Hes going ambush youre careful
Once broke McNeil settled quickly Queens He stayed hotel last summer fall life apartment wife Tatiana His cleat organized bottom locker team home opener April glove place well
Still continues hoard leather kind Though yet play first base major carry first basemans glove case He also team emergency catcher carry catcher mitt
Is going catch Frazier said You never know
McNeil recently two word sewn new outfield glove It sign finally embracing comparison restless rodent The word read Flying Squirrel

BOSTON The cleat Steve Pearces gray New Balance model 4040v4 baseball shoe 127 centimeter long It roughly distance Yankees season ended last year Bronx
That fraction inch ultimately separated Red Sox Yankees divisional playoff series Boston four game If Pearce anchored toe right foot first base plastic cleat bottom shoe tiny bit shorter throw slightly target Yankees might Game 4 carried planeload momentum doordie Game 5 Fenway Park potentially changing course postseason
Its Game 5 anything happen point Andrew Benintendi Red Sox left fielder said Boston last week Luckily well never find
On Tuesday night Bronx Pearce rest Red Sox meet Yankees first time since crucial play although encounter come team stumbling early part 2019 season
The Red Sox baseball defending champion 611 Mondays Patriots Day loss Baltimore Fenway The Yankees meanwhile 69 lost three straight series home
But back Oct 9 2018 Yankees Red Sox two best team baseball sweating tense chaotic bottom ninth Game 4 American League division series Boston securing final part Pearces right shoe stuck barely base snared throw third baseman Eduardo Nunez webbing glove
For instant time froze Pearce splayed dirt ball still glove body momentum tugged foot base The Yankees Gleyber Torres raced desperately first hitting weak grounder Nunez planted left foot bag Pearce fell On side diamond Yankees Adeiny Hechavarria tying run turned third base headed home
Had previous century early part one fortune almost always favored Yankees Red Sox perhaps Pearces foot would disconnected prematurely first base throw would skidded away Perhaps would different outcome Game 4 maybe series
Oh yeah said Aaron Boone Yankees manager authored classic YankeesRed Sox ending walkoff home run Boston Game 7 2003 American League Championship Series Its perfect gameofinches play big spot
But historic rivalry turned head last 15 year firstbase umpire Fieldin Culbreth pumped fist signal Torres Red Sox way ALCS fourth World Series title century And sense razorthin play 5foot11 player undersized position play
Im tallest first baseman world Pearce acknowledged last week recalled ending Game 4 I use every bit Steve Pearce I find get baseball I anchored bag nothing nothing going pull I caught ball
Pearce turned 36 weekend played seven team course 13year major league career said yoga But stretch lot demonstrated enough agility night catch ball clamp foot base instant
When Culbrin made call Red Sox player charged dugout celebrate But Boone nothing lose requested replay review hoping Pearces foot indeed come bag caught ball
The replay however confirmed Pearce sheer willpower never lost contact base
His foot could base much Brock Holt one Red Sox teammate recalled last week put right index finger next thumb allowing speck light seep But wasnt
That Pearce even game play bit improbable Acquired Toronto last June 28 add righthanded power Bostons bench give Manager Alex Cora platoon option first base Pearce considered much fielder
When traded everybody thought bad Cora said Pearces reputation field But made good stretch A inch could changed course series
Pearce said played shortstop high school injury forced move first base college played Indian River Community College University South Carolina eventually settled position professional But value centered offensive punch would put display last year World Series hit three home run Los Angeles Dodgers ended voted valuable player
In Game 4 Bronx Cora might even taken game bottom ninth defensive purpose first baseman Mitch Moreland sidelined injured hamstring Instead Pearce manning first Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel went mound needing three out squash Yankees good
But Kimbrel seemingly safe 41 lead erratic He walked two batter hit another surrendered single The Yankees trailed 42 one base loaded Gary Sanchez hit towering drive left field Benintendi caught warning track
The Yankees trailed 43 two out runner first second Yankee Stadium alive loud Red Sox still danger Torres came plate He slapped breaking pitch Kimbrel slowly toward third Nunez charged scooped ball fired sidearm toward Pearce
It great play Nunez Pearce said I read ball hand I moved
With right foot tethered tenuously bag Pearce moved left foot toward third And right hand went ground could brace stretched Nunezs rushed throw
The combination ball glove foot base lasted fraction second A small fraction But long enough
I wasnt going leave base chance Pearce reiterated It wasnt going happen Just anchor bag athlete
Torres meanwhile said Saturday knew overly impressed Pearces play
It right said I think every first baseman big league play No big deal He really good job But regular play
Even regular play Pearce made game would continued maybe series forcing ever confident Red Sox make one stand
Then Holt said smile would Game 5

Keeping Score
By Victor Mather
The Tampa Bay Lightning almost unstoppable season racing 62 win 82 game best point total since NHLs current system began 2006
The Lightning scored 103 goal surrendered powered Steven Stamkoss 45 Other star deep team Nikita Kucherov led league point 128 assist 87 Andrei Vasilevskiy rock goal
Its one best Ive ever played said Stamkos 11year veteran asked evaluate team January I concern u taking foot gas
But thats exactly happened The Lightning swept bestofseven series Columbus Blue Jackets even close Tampa Bay outscored 198 four game Stamkos Kucherov held pointless heading Tuesdays series finale slight reawakening star nearly enough stave 73 defeat ended season
There case made Lightning biggest playoff underachiever sport history While big playoff bust team good ever performed badly
Winning Presidents Trophy league best regular season record hardly guarantee playoff success Six time since trophy introduced 1986 team lost first round
But team least game series The worst bust 2012 Canucks lost opening series four game one But 111 point dominant Tampa Bay 128 year And win Game 4 series Los Angeles Kings went win Stanley Cup
Going back 1938 Bruins 1929 Canadiens failed win playoff game best record But bestoffive series team got bye technically lose first round And lost three game single goal
Several NBA team recent year lost first playoff series despite recorded best regularseason record But least two game series The egregious failure probably belongs 2007 Dallas Mavericks whose sterling 6715 record behind Dirk Nowitzki Josh Howard Jason Terry tarnished fourgamestotwo loss eighthseeded Warriors
The 2004 Los Angeles Sparks WNBA team season best record lose first round dropping 21 series Sacramento Monarchs
Baseball started multiround playoff system 1969 The first team league best record get swept first round 1980 Yankees 10359 lost Royals The Angels 2014 9864 also swept Royals fivegame series
But though team fine regular season approach dominance Lightning season The 2001 Mariners 11646 1906 Cubs 11636 would considered big postseason disappointment But Mariners made one playoff round losing Yankees Cubs playing era World Series entire postseason lost four game two
The NFL course different animal playoff consist singleelimination game The undefeated 2007 Patriots remembered losing Giants Super Bowl two playoff game first The worst loss first hurdle belongs 2011 Packers 151 lost 97 Giants 3720
Only two top seed lost first round NCAA tournament In 1998 Stanford woman team 215 seeded No 1 region lost No 16 Harvard Last season Virginia men matched ignominious feat lost Maryland Baltimore County
That Virginia team No 1 country 312 season Though one game defeat probably closest flameout Lightning endured
And Virginia went win title next year possible sign hope Lightning Tuesday night season ended disaster

Whos running president 2020 Keep who who candidate tracker
Tulsi Gabbard Hawaii congresswoman barely registering poll presented peace candidate opposed military intervention overseas though willingness visit President Bashar alAssad Syria attracted wide scrutiny Andrew Yang businessman political newcomer found semiviral following focus automation universal basic income

Of course Mr Trumps belief branding power presidential campaign pulled 2016 race triumph helped inspire successor But Mr Trump already famous declared intention And blistering campaign style revealed potential complication see benefit running Some toptier contender 2016 like Jeb Bush appraised low energy Mr Trumps Twitter feed came away plainly diminished national figure Others like Rick Perry Mr Carson joined Mr Trumps administration
Severe humiliation seems le likely among Democrats without leading candidate revel savaging others party In fact little lose election national campaign appears grown attractive even primary contest teeming 18 candidate
Many politician look mirror see president But least many look television see peer equivalent qualification succeeding reason wander onto set

The vast majority state shied away permitting gambling tapping nation illegal sport gambling market estimated worth 150 billion But place like Tunica people began legally betting sport August result far underwhelming
The reluctance state lawmaker gambling analyst say based growing consensus legal sport betting may bring windfall economic forecaster predicted month ago

A year Supreme Courts ruling disappointing result sport betting perhaps felt nowhere profoundly Tunica Mississippi Delta town 900 resident among poorest place nation term per caput income
The area seven casino sit outside town limit play outsize role nearly every aspect daily life Tunica including providing twothirds town annual revenue As part complex formula worked casino state town receives percentage revenue earned casino
Along Tunicas Main Street bank grocery antique shop alongside empty storefront The residential section include welltended home shaded oak tree also tiny shotgun shack
Before casino arrived 1993 unemployment rate Tunica County 26 percent And town Tunica known outsider embarrassing relic past open sewer called Sugar Ditch ran town 60 Minutes documented poverty
But legalized gambling brought change
Cotton rice field transformed casino Raw sewage stopped flowing Sugar Ditch The town began modernize
Early tourist waited four hour outside casino Highway 61 Memphis widened four lane Charter jet began arriving airport runway lengthened
At time Mississippi trailed Nevada New Jersey gambling destination Tunica area shiny new casino big draw As recently 2006 Tunicas casino took 12 billion revenue
But within year people began stay away The largest casino Harrahs Tunica closed 2014 Nearly 1000 people lost job Retail store area soon closed
As revenue stream casino shrunk town budget The annual budget town Tunica 5 million 2009 This year 35 million
The effect devastating The county poverty rate particularly among AfricanAmericans crept Over past decade number worker employed town decreased 34 65
Some resident long skeptical morality gambling Some pastor tell parishioner gambler helping save town committing sin
Mr Cariker said gamble said Tunica long held dual nature rural religious conservative also inexorably tied gambling
Its strange mayor town people dead set dependent gambling middle Bible Belt said The casino brought something Tunica get u hole
Sports betting Mississippi began allow August fueled new optimism Tunica
But January month Tunicas foray sport betting casino Tunica Roadhouse owned Caesars Entertainment closed lack business Four hundred job vanished
So far sport betting revenue brought half Tunica official expected State tax revenue Tunicas casino 630 million annually fraction
In 14000 people worked area casino 2001 compared 4300 Competition cropped gambling complex Arkansas
A lot thing happened time unfortunately Tunica got caught middle Mr Godfrey said
On recent weekday afternoon trickle people came bet game Horseshoe Tunica employee recording sport wager dressed referee uniform There offering baseball hockey Nascar boxing Major League Soccer Bundesliga Masters Golf Tournament Most people making small bet 10
Pete Polkowski 68 Iowa came bet NCAA basketball tournament decided stay extra day casino hotel try luck sport He fixated television set showing early season game Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays No one else watching
I come morning look betting line go back hotel room study couple hour said His strategy said paid though declined say much

R Scott Barber regional president Caesars MidSouth chairman Tunica Tourism Commission acknowledged crowd casino hoped materialized But said premature judge whether sport betting failure Mr Barber said positive sign including group driven five hour St Louis bet St Louis Cardinals game
Were fairly pleased early said It take time Were starting see growth first time 10 year I think market bottomed sport betting help drive growth
Many gambler never make Tunicas downtown shop Mr Cariker say still devising way get visit spend money
My job bring 10 minute south see town said He sighed moment optimism dissolved Thats real challenge
An earlier version story misstated year Tunica area largest casino Harrahs Tunica closed It closed 2014 2011

The Boston Red Sox welcomed back veteran catcher Sandy Leon Tuesdays game Bronx Leon usually coax best Chris Sale struggling ace Red Sox summoned minor dropped Blake Swihart roster
Swihart firstround draft choice eight year ago never quite reached potential Boston Mookie Betts Red Sox fifthround pick draft Most Valuable Player Award American League last season
The first day I stepped Red Sox back 2011 Betts said Tuesday night another dreary day defending World Series champion Weve tight ever since Its definitely tough But Im kind happy new beginning
The Red Sox could use new beginning They dropped 12 first 18 game latest 80 loss featuring masterpiece Yankees James Paxton Tuesday The Red Sox started badly since 1996 Roger Clemenss last season Fenway Park
As hardthrowing strikeout artist Sale heir Clemens Pedro Martinez He filled role well Boston gave fiveyear 145 million contract extension March 2024
Sale 30 1803 career strikeout pitcher 1500 inning threshold crossed bottom fifth Tuesday But point Yankees already scored four run big hit fastball DJ LeMahieu changeup Clint Frazier slider Mike Tauchman
Sale lost four start season 850 ERA His fastball harder slider sharper Tuesday would accept positive feedback five mostly lackluster inning He could remember ever pitching poorly said
Im going sugarcoat I flatout stink right Sale said adding later This flatout embarrassing family team fan This bad get I pitch better
So teammate Bostons starter 718 ERA highest major part teamwide slump despite significant injury unlike Yankees 12 player injured list
Were healthy playing good baseball Red Sox Manager Alex Cora said Weve inconsistent every aspect game pitching offense defense base running Its u clean start playing better
When one best team big league best But time right We know know way weve playing know thing get better And pretty simple Get better everything
The Yankees 79 Tuesday marked first time since 1992 rival played least 15 game season 500 But game Yankees best season contribution plate field Frazier Tauchman Gio Urshela reinforcement wounded
Got roll Manager Aaron Boone said Im sure guy little sick saying Next man truly case
Paxton arrived offseason trade Seattle supposed headliner Tuesday It best performance career last major leaguer throw completegame nohitter Mariners last May close eight shutout inning two hit 12 strikeout walk hit batter
The last Yankee fire eight scoreless inning least 12 strikeout Boston Hall Famer Mike Mussina nearperfect game Sept 2 2001
Throwing lot strike keeping middle plate even he got good life fastball said Betts struck looking 97 milesperhour heat start game He pitched amazing game
Betts hitting 212 part Bostons meager 229 team average worse every major league team final average 2018 That underscore moderating effect long season reason think healthy Red Sox roster continue struggle
But bigger problem Red Sox strength top competition Even without Luis Severino Yankees contend rotation Paxton JA Happ Masahiro Tanaka CC Sabathia Domingo German remains relatively solid And Tampa Bay Rays real major leaguebest 134 record best pitching staff major
The Red Sox look inward They concern Yankees Rays anyone else
If play well well worry thing said Dave Dombrowski Bostons president baseball operation But play way playing wont really make much difference

Six franchise World Series decade since Yankees last title three team appear schedule month The Kansas City Royals 2015 champion visit Bronx weekend The Houston Astros 2017 swept Yankees last week week Yankees swept Boston Red Sox gone pristine pitiful since claiming crown last fall
There nothing quite like emphatic sweep rival even twogame series clear away cloud Yankee Stadium After blowout Tuesday comeback Wednesday Yankees patchwork roster seem capable weathering crush injury contending yet
Theres always guy guy guy stepping trying pick best starter JA Happ said working six onethird inning Wednesdays 53 victory Were hoping get bunch guy back time game count Weve got hang
The best way starting pitching On Tuesday James Paxton became first Yankee since 2002 record least eight shutout inning 12 strikeout game A day later Happ improvised struggling fourseam fastball using twoseamers changeups keep game close Brett Gardner delivered goahead grand slam seventh
With Paxton Happ Masahiro Tanaka CC Sabathia Domingo German rotation Yankees keep game close enough bullpen offense give chance Paxton Happ combined zero quality start six outing week showed vivid detail
Those characterbuilders Manager Aaron Boone said Those thing course season I think guy benefit kind break finding way season
Speaking breaking Clint Frazier homered Tuesday went 3 4 Wednesday raising average 333 He capitalizing absence outfielder Aaron Hicks Giancarlo Stanton two 12 Yankees currently injured list making lost season endured 2018 concussion spring training
I wanted field one could put hand head work make feel better Frazier said Thats hard part Some injury go training room certain thing physically make feel better And hard one go much unknown injury It lasted long time man
Before teammate injury season Frazier 24 clear path playing time Yankees started year minor Now showing Cleveland Indians made first high school position player selected 2013 draft It might take roster gymnastics keep around fellow outfielder return injury
I look forward gymnastics Boone said adding later Hes guy talent bat speed ability impact ball kind leap screen I think everyone see
The Yankees saw July 2016 General Manager Brian Cashman acquired Frazier Justus Sheffield Indians reliever Andrew Miller move came six day extracting Gleyber Torres Billy McKinney Chicago Cubs deal closer Aroldis Chapman
Cashman played kingmaker season helping send Indians Cubs World Series The Yankees decade deal keep paying Besides production Frazier Torres starting shortstop Cashman used McKinney trade Happ Sheffield trade Paxton
Chapman course returned Yankees winning Game 7 World Series Cubs retiring Indians order ninth inning blowing save eighth That effort intense pressure possible without best stuff instructive evolution Chapman would eventually make

At event San Juan PR last year unveiling memorial Clemente Gov Ricardo A Rosselló Puerto Rico asked Commissioner Rob Manfred also attendance remove No 21 commission
His body work speaks volume I think Jackie Robinson represents greatness baseball much Roberto Clemente particularly Latinos world Rosselló said afterward So I think right time retire No 21
Manfred resisted idea saying iconic player recognized distinctive way repeatedly pointed prestigious Roberto Clemente Award given annually player embodies sportsmanship community service MLBs way honoring Clemente Manfred called award truly baseball highest honor
With without official directive many Puerto Rican player essentially tried retire number passing chance use No 21 throughout life Clementes major league team Pirates retired No 21

Delgado said used minor league 1996 season Toronto Blue Jays turning star pitcher Roger Clemens new acquisition senior player 1997 Delgado returned No 21 2006 2009 Mets
In case decision wasnt hard one said Spanish phone interview I thought important way recognize I understand side coin using number honor long honor memory career I think OK
Even Delgado said favor retiring Clementes number legacy comparable Robinsons Delgado Clemente Award 2006 said wasnt sure No 21 hadnt retired yet wondered MLB might feel pressure also retire number illustrious player Venezuela Dominican Republic two country produced many successful major leaguers
Luis Clemente whose family worked MLB past initiative involving father legacy different idea honoring No 21 He advocated number retirement sort unique visible recognition patch jersey hat worn previous year Clemente Award winner hasnt official talk MLB idea
My uncle dad living brother feel people forget dont see number Luis Clemente said I dont think thats necessarily true But go handinhand visible reminder

With right foot tethered tenuously bag Pearce moved left foot toward third And right hand went ground could brace stretched Nunezs rushed throw
The combination ball glove foot base lasted fraction second A small fraction But long enough
I wasnt going leave base chance Pearce reiterated It wasnt going happen Just anchor bag athlete

Keeping Score
By Victor Mather
The Tampa Bay Lightning almost unstoppable season racing 62 win 82 game best point total since NHLs current system began 2006
The Lightning scored 103 goal surrendered powered Steven Stamkoss 45 Other star deep team Nikita Kucherov led league point 128 assist 87 Andrei Vasilevskiy rock goal
Its one best Ive ever played said Stamkos 11year veteran asked evaluate team January I concern u taking foot gas
But thats exactly happened The Lightning swept bestofseven series Columbus Blue Jackets even close Tampa Bay outscored 198 four game Stamkos Kucherov held pointless heading Tuesdays series finale slight reawakening star nearly enough stave 73 defeat ended season
There case made Lightning biggest playoff underachiever sport history While big playoff bust team good ever performed badly
Winning Presidents Trophy league best regular season record hardly guarantee playoff success Six time since trophy introduced 1986 team lost first round
But team least game series The worst bust 2012 Canucks lost opening series four game one But 111 point dominant Tampa Bay 128 year And win Game 4 series Los Angeles Kings went win Stanley Cup
Going back 1938 Bruins 1929 Canadiens failed win playoff game best record But bestoffive series team got bye technically lose first round And lost three game single goal
Several NBA team recent year lost first playoff series despite recorded best regularseason record But least two game series The egregious failure probably belongs 2007 Dallas Mavericks whose sterling 6715 record behind Dirk Nowitzki Josh Howard Jason Terry tarnished fourgamestotwo loss eighthseeded Warriors
The 2004 Los Angeles Sparks WNBA team season best record lose first round dropping 21 series Sacramento Monarchs
Baseball started multiround playoff system 1969 The first team league best record get swept first round 1980 Yankees 10359 lost Royals The Angels 2014 9864 also swept Royals fivegame series
But though team fine regular season approach dominance Lightning season The 2001 Mariners 11646 1906 Cubs 11636 would considered big postseason disappointment But Mariners made one playoff round losing Yankees Cubs playing era World Series entire postseason lost four game two
The NFL course different animal playoff consist singleelimination game The undefeated 2007 Patriots remembered losing Giants Super Bowl two playoff game first The worst loss first hurdle belongs 2011 Packers 151 lost 97 Giants 3720
Only two top seed lost first round NCAA tournament In 1998 Stanford woman team 215 seeded No 1 region lost No 16 Harvard Last season Virginia men matched ignominious feat lost Maryland Baltimore County
That Virginia team No 1 country 312 season Though one game defeat probably closest flameout Lightning endured
And Virginia went win title next year possible sign hope Lightning Tuesday night season ended disaster

The area seven casino sit outside town limit play outsize role nearly every aspect daily life Tunica including providing twothirds town annual revenue As part complex formula worked casino state town receives percentage revenue earned casino
Along Tunicas Main Street bank grocery antique shop alongside empty storefront The residential section include welltended home shaded oak tree also tiny shotgun shack
Before casino arrived 1993 unemployment rate Tunica County 26 percent And town Tunica known outsider embarrassing relic past open sewer called Sugar Ditch ran town 60 Minutes documented poverty
But legalized gambling brought change
Cotton rice field transformed casino Raw sewage stopped flowing Sugar Ditch The town began modernize
Early tourist waited four hour outside casino Highway 61 Memphis widened four lane Charter jet began arriving airport runway lengthened
At time Mississippi trailed Nevada New Jersey gambling destination Tunica area shiny new casino big draw As recently 2006 Tunicas casino took 12 billion revenue
But within year people began stay away The largest casino Harrahs Tunica closed 2014 Nearly 1000 people lost job Retail store area soon closed
As revenue stream casino shrunk town budget The annual budget town Tunica 5 million 2009 This year 35 million
The effect devastating The county poverty rate particularly among AfricanAmericans crept Over past decade number worker employed town decreased 34 65
Some resident long skeptical morality gambling Some pastor tell parishioner gambler helping save town committing sin
Mr Cariker said gamble said Tunica long held dual nature rural religious conservative also inexorably tied gambling
Its strange mayor town people dead set dependent gambling middle Bible Belt said The casino brought something Tunica get u hole
Sports betting Mississippi began allow August fueled new optimism Tunica
But January month Tunicas foray sport betting casino Tunica Roadhouse owned Caesars Entertainment closed lack business Four hundred job vanished
So far sport betting revenue brought half Tunica official expected State tax revenue Tunicas casino 630 million annually fraction
In 14000 people worked area casino 2001 compared 4300 Competition cropped gambling complex Arkansas
A lot thing happened time unfortunately Tunica got caught middle Mr Godfrey said
On recent weekday afternoon trickle people came bet game Horseshoe Tunica employee recording sport wager dressed referee uniform There offering baseball hockey Nascar boxing Major League Soccer Bundesliga Masters Golf Tournament Most people making small bet 10
Pete Polkowski 68 Iowa came bet NCAA basketball tournament decided stay extra day casino hotel try luck sport He fixated television set showing early season game Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays No one else watching
I come morning look betting line go back hotel room study couple hour said His strategy said paid though declined say much

R Scott Barber regional president Caesars MidSouth chairman Tunica Tourism Commission acknowledged crowd casino hoped materialized But said premature judge whether sport betting failure Mr Barber said positive sign including group driven five hour St Louis bet St Louis Cardinals game
Were fairly pleased early said It take time Were starting see growth first time 10 year I think market bottomed sport betting help drive growth
Many gambler never make Tunicas downtown shop Mr Cariker say still devising way get visit spend money
My job bring 10 minute south see town said He sighed moment optimism dissolved Thats real challenge

Aroldis Chapman nicknamed Cuban Missile reason The Yankees lanky lefthanded closer Caribbean island long prominent face velocity explosion modern baseball Ever since broke major league 2010 pitcher could match 100milesperhour fastball
Until last season A month injured list left knee tendinitis sapped power average fastball speed dipped slightly previous season 989 mph He still among hardest thrower baseball first time since 2013 Chapman top St Louis Cardinals relief pitcher Jordan Hicks nine year younger claimed title 1005mph average according Fangraphs
Thats problem Chapman 31 said Spanish recently adding later Im 20 22 anymore The year pile choice
So eyebrow including injured inconsistent Yankees understandably raised Chapman began season albeit early April chill Northeast throwing fastball slow 92 mph It yet another potentially worrying issue Yankees bullpen lived lofty expectation depleted roster general
But Chapman concerned reason In keeping past earlyseason buildup speed ticked outing reaching 98 100 mph ease two recent appearance In admittedly small sample size seven game average back 971 mph entering Friday night 62 win Kansas City Royals
As I get work I feel much better arm better well velocity pitch said Chapman Little little A lot people worry velocity Im worried
But average pick temperature inning ultimately settle
Chapman fivetime AllStar still outlier given long held velocity Yet continues aging even Chapman think average 100 mph entire season anymore Nor want especially resurgence wipeout slider
My first year yes I trying throw hard I said But year mentality start changing My objective isnt throw hard pitch For example tossing inning pitch possible throwing firstpitch strike every batter
There time last season Chapmans velocity hovered around 97 mph Larry Rothschild Yankees longtime pitching coach thought might new norm
But youd see big number Rothschild said As warms get youll still see But he thrown lot fastball high velocity point youre going see little bit dip
It feel preposterous doubt whether 97 mph enough Many professional pitcher unable throw hard let alone average entire sixmonth season many year The average fastball baseball last season 928 mph according Fangraphs But Chapman freakishly athletic set new norm
The year gone back Cuban Missile good said But many pitcher throwing hard Maybe two three pitcher throwing 100
There reach even starting pitcher Chapman marveled Hickss arm uncorked 105 mph fastball game last May matching Chapman fastest pitch recorded baseball history And hard thrower havent reached big league yet Chapman said
Even though Chapman mitigated aging process bulking oncegangly 6foot4 frame arm continue lose power time His fastball already induced fewer swing miss year 2017 2018 lowest rate since start career
Still Chapman pointed even 96mph fastball would enough succeed major long still get out And seven outing season mostly allowing two run taking one loss striking nine walking one
Because sizable lead Friday Yankees 910 didnt need Chapman Starter CC Sabathia allowed one unearned run five inning bullpen rest Outfielders Brett Gardner Mike Tauchman homered helping Yankees overcome three error field
For Chapman one thing helped evolve slider Before departing via free agency last season reliever David Robertson helped Chapman tweak grip slider led sharper movement proved successful second half
Chapman used slider careerhigh 25 percent time last season partly Yankees urging Opponents hit 106 whiffed 62 percent time swung highest rate slider among relief pitcher baseball last season according Baseball Prospectus
And far season third Chapmans fiveyear 86 million deal Yankees using slider even 31 percent time He said never felt better
Thats slider pitch still electric stuff I think long want he healthy give pitch thats going give longevity Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said last month adding later It really impressed last year started use There time able strike pitch better fastball
That say Chapmans trademark pitch feeble yet After seeing fastball 95 96 mph Chapman ninth inning April 6 game Baltimore Orioles outfielder Trey Mancini struck 98 mph offering middle plate
It seemed even harder Mancini said I thought probably 100 eye test Its still electric pitch Hes really tall guy release ball seems like right top
Two day Mancini saw three slider Chapman lining final one
A lot people dont know His slider pretty darn good pitch Mancini said And age anything like slider still going make fastball look really hard even slightly le hard used

If build come
Puhlease
Thirty year release Field Dreams time major reassessment
Sorry folk view baseball movie sort timeless metaphor connecting past understanding America really
In reality another terrible film
If somehow get past factual error horrible casting Ray Goodfellas Liotta Shoeless Joe Jackson realize nothing epic helping corniness passed ethereal fantasy get deeper meaning life apparently nothing chance play one game catch athletically challenged dad
Like many people I remember gushing Field Dreams released April 21 1989 also time I still clung schmaltzy belief pushed folk George Will Bob Costas baseball sport It national pastime slowmoving game somehow managed epitomize great country patch grass dirt marked 90foot path
Or James Earl Jones character reclusive author Terence Mann tell Kevin Costners Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella one film signature scene The one constant year Ray baseball America rolled like army steamroller Its erased like blackboard rebuilt erased But baseball marked time This field game part past Ray It reminds u good could
Can someone pas barf bag
That sequence get one major problem Field Dreams conveniently ignores ugly racial history baseball America even though chose cast Jones one esteemed AfricanAmerican actor central character In novel movie based Shoeless Joe reclusive author JD Salinger filmmaker apparently afraid lawsuit referenced came fictional character instead
Jones Terence Mann told 1960s firebrand whose push social change radical Iowa school want ban book Yet he mesmerized cornfield feature bunch player era Major League Baseball white
To briefly recap Costners Kinsella owner struggling Midwest farm wandering stalk one evening hears ominous voice command If build come This lead mow part crop construct baseball field even though likely cause financial ruin Its never explained using small patch land farm appeared hundred thousand acre would cause go digress
We also learn Kinsella troubled relationship father idolized Jackson despite implicated Black Sox scandal One day Jackson appears field Chicago uniform later return seven player accused taking payoff throw 1919 World Series
We also find Shoeless Joe wont let ghost Ty Cobb play wasnt good guy
No jerk allowed field
But fixed World Series
No problem
After hearing voice Kinsella take Boston wind kidnapping Mann go game Fenway Park travel Minnesota pick ghost Moonlight Graham portrayed Burt Lancaster final film role based real person played one game major league didnt get chance hit went become doctor reveals fallingout father Black Sox return Iowa watch ghost playing ball well blah blah blah
Moving ahead spoiler alert Graham finally get chance bat big leaguers though strangely hit sacrifice fly still doesnt count official atbat even ghost Mann follows Jackson player corn stalk apparently integrate baseball great beyond Then Kinsella get chance play one last game catch dad field whole time obscured catcher gear throw like someone who never picked baseball life
Field Dreams success box office hit critic apparently skipped scene Liotta portraying Jackson born raised died South Carolina Liotta played Jackson wisecracking demeanor New York accent would fit part much better following year portrayed turncoat mobster actual movie classic Goodfellas
The baseball flick nominated best picture Academy Awards losing Driving Miss Daisy clearly year film industry added National Film Registry historical significance 2017 No mention made cliche lead movie bestknown line would inspire lazy sportswriter yep included every time new stadium built
If want watch Costner baseball movie entertainment value may suggest Bull Durham
Field Dreams deserves ghosted

WEST PALM BEACH Fla I walked spring training locker room Houston Astros question assembled player What going slow pace freeagent contract winter
Alex Bregman Astros star third baseman finished taking morning hack field likely future occupant baseball penthouse He could earn munificent contract sort handed Bryce Harper 330 million Manny Machado 300 million past two week But see many dozen ballplayer fallen short stardom without contract anger
Worse see team content mediocrity Fewer club competing sign star A lot team seem fine losing getting TV money making attempt sign player said That bad game
I wandered Josh Reddicks locker Lithe free spirit he good right fielder careful observer game He suggested perhaps baseball player follow lead NBA player speak
A lot guy pissed said There lot guy job hanging If take another bad strike change thats need
We arrived hinge point sport From angry baseball player talking strike quarterback Colin Kaepernick running back LeVeon Bell NBA player LeBron James Stephen Curry Chris Paul professional athlete splendidly outspoken They opine President Trump popular culture sport economics indisputably stirring see young men woman looking beyond horizon win loss
Yet politicization play radically different way invariably benefit athlete Baseball groove constrained tradition It powerful union strongest pro sport coexists sense individuality suspect player big sport
So baseball player sail toward possible confrontation owner without leader posse transcendent cultural cachet business power say LeBron James
It feel like baseball life past undercut player power noted Adrian Burgos history professor University Illinois editor La Vida Baseball study Latino influence baseball Whereas NBA imago future create world player power
The NBA player many sport tell stand zeitgeist prototype freespirited league youngest fan base average age NBA viewer 37 compared 55 baseball Its star become hybrid player power broker globespanning businessmen So James signed Los Angeles Lakers eye toward building entertainment empire spent much February trying force New Orleans Pelicans trade star center Anthony Davis Lakers

Yes A Davis
The NBA life nothing intersectional experience
Baseball football tightly bound culture history The NFL long ago went Death Star dominance sated money nose wrinkled distaste dissent The owner cut presumably large check Kaepernick almost certainly blackballed taking dignified knee national anthem There assurance run onto NFL field
Player solidarity football barely flickering lamp When Bell refused report Steelers training camp last fall The Pittsburgh PostGazette reported teammate removed name plate plundered locker shoe Bell decided sit 2018 season rather accept constraining franchisetag deal
The NFL capitalized post911 patriotism sense shield bigger player infects sport David Leonard professor teach intersection race culture sport Washington State Pullman said

NBA player taking role marketing future Leonard said You see concerted effort wield power create power
This escaped notice baseball player In world much individuality wearing hat backward tossing bat like baton home run draw roll eye
Reddick Astros right fielder watched NBA player admiration Basketball player outspoken opinion said Baseball always giving generic cliché answer keep guessing Basketball player much outspoken go lot depth
Analytics border Holy Writ baseball front office many sportswriter act strangely diminish star even moment glory So told Harper intense seemingly transcendent young star le appears WAR rating last year win replacement rather subjective statistic low There implicit suggestion player fan would well yield numeracy triumphalism

The Reds also revived farm system high draft pick like Nick Senzel No 2 2016 could starting center fielder Williams general manager Nick Krall also used prospect draft pick trade Gray Yankees Roark Washington Nationals Kemp Puig Wood Dodgers

Were loop Casali said Were trying progressive give best chance competing
The Reds still face rigorous challenge NL Central every team expects contend If Reds fall far behind midsummer tempted trade Wood Kemp Puig Roark free agent season
But first time several year Reds pretend They division favorite hopeful That count something
You dont everything based Well raise playoff odds much much maybe Williams said Hey give u better chance Lets go Its time

I love way throw ball position defense Andujar said Spanish recent afternoon Yankees spring training site And prepares pitch ready position little hop
There several reason Yankees seriously pursue Machado highprofile free agency They wanted spread money around various improvement rather spending single chunk Machados 10year 300 million contract San Diego Padres proved secondlargest freeagent deal North American sport history
Beyond money also fact team already possessed talented young third baseman Andujar finished second American League rookie year voting last season despite defensive wart
We recognize player playing around game might better thats fine Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said recently You cant
He added later The product strong one And want best possibly If good enough judge recommendation ownership
And long Yankees decided formally make offer Machado already working improve Andujars defense
Andujars talent particularly plate undeniable even early 2011 signed Yankees 16 native Dominican Republic Last season Yankees planned Brandon Drury third base Andujar took job combination injury others performance
In 149 game Andujar posted 855 onbaseplusslugging percentage hit 297 topped Washington Nationals star Anthony Rendon among major league third baseman Andujars 27 homer 92 run batted trailed Giancarlo Stanton Yankees
But field Andujar shaky While committed 15 error last year AL Gold Glove winner position Oaklands Matt Chapman charged 20 Andujar struggled regard Advanced defensive metric rated worst fielding third baseman among least 900 inning last season In doordie Game 4 AL divisional series Boston Red Sox Yankees Manager Aaron Boone opted Neil Walker third base instead Andujar

Recently couple successful quarterback stand south six foot tall But short tall Murray Clearly neutral arbiter NFL combine would figure That happens

Murray clarified thing well patiently addressing scrum reporter averagesize hand side
Yes football final answer
I born football player said I love game There turning back
No concerned choosing football baseball doomed smaller paycheck A reporter brought 13year 330 million contract reached Thursday Philadelphia Phillies Bryce Harper How much per year Murray wished know About 254 million
Theres quarterback making year Murray said indeed

MESA Ariz So happens help deliver team first championship century Do grateful fan really buy meal drink rest life
Sometimes happens oh yeah definitely said Kyle Schwarber Chicago Cubs left fielder exhibition game day Were always trying take advantage people nice gesture get We always make sure try take care em
On field Cubs continued rewarding fan since magical championship run 2016 They returned playoff two season since part fouryear stretch game major league team 387
But standard changed Chicago front office wonder much get core The Cubs 95win regular season felt awfully empty crashed burned twoday fiasco Wrigley Field last October First Milwaukee Brewers stole National League Central crown onegame playoff Colorado Rockies eliminated Cubs 13inning wildcard game
I think everybody including trying everything instead team second baseman Javier Baez said You make harder u team I think waited season look try make adjustment obviously game day
The Cubs first team kicked postseason stage became another showcase Theo Epsteins former team Boston Red Sox fourth championship century Epsteins influence roster remains Mookie Betts Jackie Bradley Jr Xander Bogaerts signed general manager Cubs lack companion piece 2016 trophy
To get Epstein Cubs president baseball operation brought back nearly entire roster 2018 dropping significant player adding margin infielder Daniel Descalso reliever Brad Brach Xavier Cedeno But group run chance Epstein said continues struggle stretch
In second half completely fell apart offensively Epstein said We went worst quartile We hitting ball softly hitting ball ground striking walking getting base We went exactly want first half exactly dont want
We still havent really put finger

Epstein underscored urgency November announcing would discus contract extension Manager Joe Maddon least
Ive always believed job thing take care Ive always worked premise said Maddon former Tampa Bay manager earns 6 million per year deal expires season Ive worked oneyear deal minor league first deal Rays twoyear option Ive
Im really concerned quite frankly I feel actually pretty good Its interesting situation I really anticipate long time I know outside Im going get lot question best way I answer like Im talking owning staying focused present tense Thats best way handle situation
There usual handle field offseason Cubs Shortstop Addison Russell given 40game suspension domestic violence late last season 28 game still served In February news outlet Splinter published cache racist email sent received Joe Ricketts billionaire patriarch family owns Cubs focused fear Muslims contained conspiracy theory former President Barack Obama
Epstein gave lengthy condemnation Ricketts email start spring training Russell opened camp saying proud person apologizing exwife Melisa
I want action Russell said last month I want accountable hurt I put Melisa pain went Thats I want
Maddon combine newage charisma deep background scouting coaching taken verb made latest series annual slogan us guide player
The motto officially You see everywhere spring training player Tshirts WiFi password complex Maddon said heard broadcaster Tony Romo use describe approach calling Super Bowl
Im sitting around one day Im trying come thought I wrote theyre generated letter Maddon said The phrase pretty prominent general day
Part Maddons task season said coach coach even referring group includes new bench coach Mark Loretta new pitching coach Tommy Hottovy two new hitting coach Anthony Iapoce Terrmel Sledge
Iapoce worked Schwarber Kris Bryant others Cubs minor league instructor recently coach three season Texas Rangers In year Rangers hit home run Cubs led NL batting average hit last season fewest homer since 2014 finished last place
Theres lot stud room plenty good year said Bryant former valuable player hit 13 homer 102 game dealt shoulder injury last season We know talent lot AllStars lot World Series champion guy around long time
One player lefthander Cole Hamels thrived arriving trade Texas last July Hamels 236 ERA 12 start better Cubs debut former Rangers teammate Yu Darvish made eight start 495 ERA elbow triceps injury
Hes lightning bottle hitter putting ball play Hamels said Darvish Hes got swingandmiss stuff youre able especially National League youre getting seven eight inning right closer
Darvish signed sixyear 126 million contract last season belief pitch like maybe even better After two sharp inning Chicago White Sox Sunday Darvish declared Im best right career
Why
Because Im throwing 97 slider really good split good Darvish 32 said Thats best stuff life
Maybe typical spring training hyperbole But one leastsatisfying 95win season major league history Cubs could use little optimism They might well

PHOENIX The original owner Milwaukee Brewers Bud Selig always insisted team lost 1982 World Series injury Hall Fame closer Rollie Fingers All year later well past Seligs long tenure commissioner remains World Series appearance franchise history
Last fall Brewers came close returning ever Game 7 National League Championship Series lost Los Angeles Dodgers They made sure pack bullpen time The Brewers three star closer roster starter small fraction strategy
It radical way reimagine pitching bold experiment making October debut The Brewers used bullpen nearly twothirds postseason inning 60⅓ 93⅔ half game starter gone three
In limited duty starter earned run average sparkling 162 testament power manipulation Brewers refusal let starter cost game
Last year motto pitching staff Any guy time said Corbin Burnes rookie reliever He added We knew role pitching staff stuck got u one game away
Burnes auditioning starting role like Freddy Peralta Brandon Woodruff also pitched mostly relief rookie last October That trio helped set another Josh Hader Jeremy Jeffress Corey Knebel
Hader Jeffress Knebel formed postmodern mashup Randy Johnson JR Richard Nolan Ryan Together fanned 320 batter 213⅓ inning They AllStars within last two year Manager Craig Counsell taught ready anything
Every one important out game Knebel said Every inning save situation thats way Counsell teach
Still Counsell know manage April August way September expanded roster October regular offdays Even Brewer thrown complete game since Jimmy Nelson June 2017 worked 200 inning season since Yovani Gallardo 2012
Great starting pitcher still manager best friend said Counsell though added job simply find best way get 27 out Its personnel Who player good How connect
The Brewers playoff team since 1982 included former Cy Young Award winner rented trade C C Sabathia 2008 Zack Greinke 2011 Last year ace Jhoulys Chacin joined Milwaukee offseason bargain contract two year 155 million thrived following Brewers suggestion throw slider Chacin 158 Brewer work required 162 inning qualify ERA title
In relying mostly Chacin nowdeparted Wade Miley postseason starter Miley faced one batter decoy Game 5 Dodgers Counsell bypassed mainstay helped Brewers get Chase Anderson Zach Davies Junior Guerra combined 141 start last two season afterthought playoff
I tried best teammate I could I knew I wasnt going roster said Anderson 98 393 ERA Im optimistic person pessimistic person thats personality get I wanted much anybody
Being since 2016 seeing rebuilding process expedited faster people thought yeah hard
Anderson revamped mechanic winter studied video Mike Mussina Hall Fame righthander whose precision creativity admires He competing Davies Burnes Peralta Woodruff former Cleveland righthander Josh Tomlin rotation spot behind Chacin Nelson bit behind recovers shoulder injury
Davies former 17game winner said goal work 200 inning That number remains point pride starter get Just 13 pitcher reached 200 inning last season 45 2010 Teams like Brewers Oakland Athletics especially Tampa Bay Rays opener strategy want quality quantity starter
As industry weve learned really tough consistently pitch seven eight nine inning effectively rope unquestionably shorter Brewers General Manager David Stearns said Having said every organization looking multiple pitcher every organization give guy chance show ability
I mean Rays aggressive opener paradigm still Blake Snell every organization I would imagine would love Blake Snell would use skill set max
The Brewers hope find ace like Snell American League Cy Young Award winner among Burnes Peralta Woodruff combined 260 ERA NLCS 29 strikeout 17⅓ inning Starters use wider array pitch reliever though fair ask three quite dominant rotation
Thats question answer Counsell said But time always going need player stage career take next step
This 50th season Brewers Milwaukee still taken final step As try continue seek creative way get out
It kind challenge thinking Counsell said end finding better answer

Re Dont Pay College Athletes Cody J McDavis OpEd Feb 26
Wait minute Isnt purpose college provide education Division I sport particularly football basketball corrupted college athletics totally lost sight purpose college Higher education would much better college university followed Division III rule academic scholarship
As Mr McDavis suggests let National Basketball Association developmental league pay aspiring young basketball talent Also let minor league baseball continue pay aspiring young baseball player And organize developmental football league pay aspiring pro football player
The issue whether student paid whether professional sport belong university
Tom BarnardShaker Heights Ohio
To Editor
Cody J McDavis opinion paying athlete play college sport wrong would ruin college sport We already road ruin time
Unfortunately top division college football basketball become predictable point boredom Sure occasional interloper Virginia Commonwealth University George Mason Butler generally team mix sport Think Alabama Clemson football Duke Kentucky North Carolina Michigan basketball
We face fact pay student done romantic notion school spirit amateur competition It money nothing
Some rule rule would keep student school four year would keeping spirit National Collegiate Athletic Association However given level money corruption real change going happen Paying athlete would least small step toward honesty
Gerald BowmanMunich
To Editor
Cody J McDavis say paying college athlete would create arm race select group college program could compete In reality arm race exactly college sport currently function This particularly true major college football basketball program
Colleges build multimilliondollar sport facility attract top recruit And salary coach major football basketball program ballooned recent year What would call arm race Worse yet NCAA cartel prevented player receiving fair compensation winner arm race coach athletic director Unsurprisingly usually first people argue paying player
While arm race governs major college sport select group top program healthy ecosystem exists opportunity midmajor nonscholarship intercollegiate competition I personally grateful opportunity existed I confident similar opportunity would exist even successful college player paid fairly
Compensating top structure value bring ruin college sport It ensure college sport remain something enjoyed many fan student alumnus

On Feb 20 le minute nationally televised game archrival North Carolina Dukes Zion Williamson injured right knee one Nike sneaker exploded The incident revived question whether shoe company able pay player exclusively wear gear whether college athlete get cut profit We posed question student Student Opinion question
The response split middle student side debate arguing case persuasively We chose comment used compelling combination logic ethic emotion statistic even United States law support claim
No college athlete paid
I think really already getting paid When talk college athlete getting paid usually talking best best The one full scholarship college many time college would cost ten thousand even hundred thousand college athlete dont need pay anything They given access best facility world sometimes even better professional sport team With facility player push limit become best version
If bring actual money college sport change forever change dynamic whole sport Many player love college choose right college coach always welcomed back second home Not player given facility develop great athlete choose great coach coach mold great young men fit anything At Clemson University emphasis Dabo Swinney head coach football team recruit athlete find fitting program The whole vibe Clemson good vibe many player build bond last forever In college experience great one really isnt college experience player paid becomes another division professional sport

College sport preparation professional sport This drive many athlete attain college level skill use competitive game intense training get feel higher level Tracy argues many organization reap billion dollar effort talent preprofessional athlete Yes game televised doesnt bring profit company college It publicizes player give opportunity scouted professional coach
Zoe Lee Hoggard Wilmington NC
I feel student athlete attending school play sport also obtain good education succeed life When playing sport school basically representing school whatever sport playing While playing school coordinator sport volunteer put lot money make sure essential need order play College Athletes provided much stuff dont really need worry money They well taken cared
Icess Tresvik John T Hoggard High
At first I believed college athlete paid work hard good professional provide source entertainment sell million ticket per game play However reading comment section Ive changed mind The whole point college get good education use education future help guide way career However start getting paid focus money education That result decrease interest education grade college player also decrease leading chance pro athlete decreasing well Furthermore college athlete get paid pay likely different player create competitive atmosphere among team athlete If college athlete get paid pay player defines instead skill Therefore I think college athlete shouldnt paid
Soyoung SSIS HCMC Vietnam
Yes college athlete deserve cut profit
In opinion I believe college athlete paid least able get type income These athlete bringing 11 billion dollar year including TV broadcasting ticket even sponsor Also NCAA prohibits athlete getting job receiving type income athlete dont come high rich family dont receive full ride dont know pay rest tuition
In case Zion Williamson sure paid The game Duke UNC come cheap average price game little nine thousand cheapest price little three thousand That call Zion effect
Tayo Ojo Everman High School
People always say college athlete thankful get scholarship scholarship arent enough Degrees useless athlete They often dont get meaningful degree They dont connection come job arent allowed get internship NCAA rule Students also cant work season Most dont care subject I dont blame balance sport class schedule sound like nightmare They arent guided life outside sport If student get job outside sport theyre going hard time competing job market
The athlete get paid something fall back dont become professional athlete le 2 chance happening Even college useful 3 athlete get enough grant scholarship cover full cost college NCAA doesnt even compensate player injury There 8 injury every 1000 41000 injury 2004 2009 Players lose scholarship get injured The word studentathlete created 50 avoid worker compensation
Ami S Masterman Philadelphia
At first glance prospect paying college student salary top scholarship seems ridiculous However look closer case case basis becomes ridiculous ignore evidence point contrary For college athlete level competition train devote entire life becoming physical specimen needed play division one athletics With kind commitment excellence often come disregard thing If student spending time becoming athlete studying learning well suited world sport Therefore using student talent make money NCAA compensating player stealing compromising future forever
Ezra Lombardi
Tickets Duke v Carolina game sold upwards 2000 dollar I personally guarantee athlete like Zion Williamson see penny money Ironically without athlete event would possible Although college athlete receive prestigious scholarship minuscule compared amount college brand NCAA make one game alone I believe college athlete receive percentage money made event participate game play use image
Even though college athlete paid fame training scholarship also definite risk drawback Injury constant risk could potentially end career athlete time Zion Williamson perfect example injury worse career could ended athletic scholarship would revoked
Erin Johnston Hoggard High School Wilmington NC
They paid
People brought point scholarship arent enough since NCAA college make much money game player paid But player played game much would paid Would athlete paid amount would paid based amount ticket sell game
I think athlete paid fixed amount game would good way able keep playing sport well able money survive college But I feel like system like put place would outrage People would say athlete paid based amount ticket game sell really fair Obviously college football basketball sell ticket far player team would get paid But sport like track baseball would sell anywhere near much ticket player would paid le
I think system put place would outrage would lead debate NCAA system bench player rarely see playing time would paid star sport I think way resolve pay issue would let student athlete get job
Paul N NHRHS NJ
Studentathletes exploited school NCAA shoe company
I believe studentathletes paid something addition scholarship grant even minimal Big corporation take money athlete For example Nike get showcase jersey shoe every single national televised game Meanwhile Zion getting anything Every Williamson jersey sold isnt giving money Zion It going toward Nike If college athlete allowed sign shoe brand Zion would definitely brand Overall NCAA company taking advantage studentathletes athlete getting paid something
Michael H NHRHS
Companies like Nike NCAA turn collage player walking ad yet player get nothing Its like didnt pay put ad billboard billboard self dependent living thing needed somehow pay food decent living space also taking class billboard practice every day class one single scrape billboard could mean end carrier except career dont get paid I cant put Zion Williamsons shoe Im situation I way know fact I believe would justified sitting rest college season end day concerned prosperity prosperity executive run NCAA
Henry Scott JR Masterman Philadelphia PA
Yes If use athlete likeness compensated fairly If Zion jersey sold bookstore regardless whether last name jersey theyre using commercial image sell tix compensated percentage sale

At behest Major League Baseball Atlantic League independent minor league based mostly Northeast try several rule change coming season MLB said goal create ball play defensive action base running improve player safety
Baseball made promise eventually including change major presumably experiment merely academic interest
The change

A week back I drove across central Florida flatland farm cattle sweetsmelling orange grove company childhood friend Peter Kurz talked prone many year lifelong obsession New York Mets
We recalled preadolescent battery Soldiers Sailors Monument Manhattans Upper West Side imaginary Tom Seaver tossing fastball imaginary Jerry Grote We got everyone course Willie Stargell Roberto Clemente Frank Brooks Robinson way Tom Terrific rolled
The 1969 Mets inhabited consciousness happens hypnotic beauty baseball sink hook kid Those Mets world champion guy stepping mortality shadow year Tommie Agee Donn Clendenon Ed Charles Tug McGraw gone lay claim shock another star moving stage
Except Seaver immortal forever young composed fiercely competitive analytical effort Now family say age 74 suffers dementia see public life He tend vineyard Napa long
Read About Seaver family announcement baseball legend dementia retire public life
That I remember maybe thats point withdrawal He powerful stocky pitcher California dominated mound like tenor astride stage He would pull cap run hand thick shock hair ready rear toss rear toss No need put 20second clock mound pure business batter fiddled around much might sneak hard fastball batter chin way reminder buckle
He perfected dropandthrust delivery dropping far threw measure good night whether right knee dirt dragging mound No weight work iron sled ran worked light weight And still fastball crackled
Magic could happen night pitched tried wheedle parent letting stay watch blackandwhite WOR Channel 9 broadcast youd curl bed transistor radio listen Bob Murphy paint picture Seaver tossing tossing
Data sportswriting crutch although also true baseball without statistic like Bible without word So 1969 Seaver went 257 221 earned run average He also threw five completegame shutout
I recently took look prevailing little questioned orthodoxy starting pitcher go six seven inning game By way making point Seaver became insane outlier If hitter wanted get welladvised swing early Seaver tuned curve live snake fastball His career ERA first inning game 375 In last three inning lifetime ERA 275
And forgive statistical drunkenness peakperformance Tom tilted absurdity In 1969 pitched ninth inning 17 time surrendered single run
Oh yes September year went 60 083 ERA All courtesy BaseballReferencecom
Seaver like peer Bob Gibson Juan Marichal Jim Palmer grooved competition That never true 1973 Mets became unlikely team baseball history reach World Series stumbling postseason motley record 8279 Many Mets injured season fell one ditch another yet somehow dusted made Series vastly powerful Oakland As
That series went taut seven game Seaver facing Reggie Jackson alone worth price admission Reggie led American League home run run batted year Seaver Seaver 1910 208 ERA 250 strikeout Reggie strutted plate wigglewagging bat ready struggle Seaver looked Grote sign really much doubt call would
My mind eye recall Seaver throwing le nothing fastball mano mano He got Jackson Jackson got Seaver perhaps best Series actually lost game 240 ERA He also struck 18 men 15 inning
This fairy tale ended badly Seaver wanted money Mets board chairman M Donald Grant imperious point selfsatire bridled help acting Goaded Dick Young reactionary columnist The Daily News Grant sent Seaver exile Cincinnati If city Ohio River Elba made well enough going 143 first year
None felt right though He essential Met He returned midst Mets Dark Ages 1983 team lost 94 game He old man baseball term vigor left fastball still fashioned reasonable season 355 ERA He gave 201 hit 231 inning
He moved itinerant starter 16 game age 40 White Sox A year later called quits He Hall Fame career one best history game cumulative career earnings 20 year totaled hair 6 million roughly average relief pitcher make today game
Me I remember trying mimic dropandthrust motion And I recall riding No 7 train Shea Stadium friend Peter We bought 130 ticket took seat doubleheader Jerry Koosman opener Tom Terrific nightcap

WASHINGTON Members Congress like say governing game increasingly playing round round gotcha
As watershed election loom next year little real significance happening legislative front lawmaker consumed trying trap one another hotbutton vote dont much real legislative business
Whether show vote really matter come actual voter another issue entirely It hard find case incumbent senator representative knocked solely illconsidered decision postmidnight votearama Senate particularly devious motion recommit House
Its unlikely single vote undermine member reelection chance said Nathan L Gonzales nonpartisan political handicapper editor publisher Inside Elections
Still going stop anyone particularly Republicans moment trying Much activity Capitol Hill day akin trolling Twitter tackling national priority
For instance Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Kentucky majority leader gleefully preparing force Democrats take stand socalled Green New Deal resolution among thing call 100 percent American energy come clean source within 10 year
The nonbinding document essentially set ambitious progressive goal zero chance passage Republicancontrolled Senate Donald J Trump president As legislation would take year develop push Congress But Republicans itching vote get Democrats notably presidential contender record They relentlessly mocked Green New Deal framework eliminating airplane travel cheeseburger restriction fossil fuel cow emission
We done wacky thing side wackiest thing I ever seen said Senator Lamar Alexander Republican Tennessee
Democrats call coming Republican maneuver cynical stunt They suggested simply vote present recorded resolution stance may cost progressive want Democrats courage conviction matter premature vote might
At time Senator Chuck Schumer New York Democratic leader demanded Republicans offer alternative offer seem unlikely accept He also want vote separate Democratic resolution would call immediate action climate change His trap try either force Republicans admit climate change real deny result could hurt matter outcome
When Leader McConnell going schedule time consideration climate change legislation asked Mr Schumer newly embracing climate change issue appeal younger voter
While Senate playing green deal green deal House caught arcane struggle give term inside baseball bad name Newly relegated minority House Republicans tormenting Democratic majority known motion recommit
It basically one final opportunity minority party amend legislation pas floor It transformed party year minority leader learned spring politically charged MTRs known majority last minute Mayor Rahm Emanuel Chicago former member House Democratic leadership cut political teeth House race one early adapter weaponized motion recommit considered form psychological political warfare
Obviously gotcha amendment designed give people political problem said Representative Steny H Hoyer Democrat Maryland majority leader And way thats So new know invention Republicans
For Democrats problem Republicans seem better drafting motion Now passing support nervous new Democratic lawmaker tough district dont want caught wrong side issue gun sale immigration antiSemitism domestic violence The split incited internal party fight leader worried motion pas considered serious rather procedural lead political problem road
You member le percentage point I sympathy said Representative Jim McGovern Democrat Massachusetts oversees Rules Committee But said Democrats could allow Republicans carry day political guerrilla attack We legitimize underhanded tactic It put people bad spot
The Republican success Democrats calling rule change either dilute eliminate motion recommit talk Republicans cry foul They say Democrats already retreating pledge make House transparent bipartisan Republican control previous eight year
Here two month new Democratic majority touted open debate issue process said Representative Tom Cole Oklahoma top Republican Rules Committee He called discussion change motion recommit affront institution
Mr McGovern said consideration change would part extensive dialogue After spending fair amount time minority showed reluctance tinker motion recommit matter potential penalty Democrats
I still believe minority guaranteed constructive voice legislative process Mr McGovern said You cant shut everybody That place shouldnt
It probably also shouldnt running game gotcha
