https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/47998714,"Defending champion Rafael Nadal suffered a shock 6-4 6-2 defeat by Italian Fabio Fognini in the semi-finals of the Monte Carlo Masters.

The 32-year-old Spaniard, seeking his 12th Monte Carlo title, had won his past 18 matches at the event and lost only four of 75 in his career.

World number 18 Fognini, 31, will face Serb Dusan Lajovic in Sunday's final.

""I played one of my worst matches on clay in 14 years,"" said world number two Nadal.

""It's difficult to find any positives. I deserved to lose.""

World number 48 Lajovic reached his first ATP final with a 7-5 6-1 win over Novak Djokovic's conqueror Daniil Medvedev.

Lajovic, 28, came from 5-1 down to win 10 successive games against the 10th seed and become the lowest ranked Monte Carlo finalist since 2001.

Fognini, who was a set and 4-1 down to Andrey Rublev in the first round, won in one hour 36 minutes to reach a Masters 1000 final for the first time.

He became only the fourth player to win three or more matches against Nadal on clay, and the first Italian to reach the Monte Carlo final since Corrado Barazzutti in 1977.

Playing his first tournament for a month after opting to rest his troublesome knees, Nadal added: ""I had a bad feeling; it was a tough day.

""I'm coming from low moments in terms of injuries, and in terms of the mental side it has not been easy to accept all the things that have been going on during recent weeks.

""Everything was wrong. I always expect the best. But you have to be ready to accept the negative things, and it was a negative day.""

Britain's Jamie Murray and Brazilian partner Bruno Soares lost 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 to Dutchmen Robin Haase and Wesley Koolhof in the doubles semi-finals."
http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2019/04/novak-djokovic-daniil-medvedev-2019-monte-carlo-masters-upset/81050/,"“Watch out Medvedev,” Tennis Channel commentator Leif Shiras said, “Djokovic means business.”

The third set of Friday’s quarterfinal between Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev had just begun, and the Serb had taken a 0-30 lead on the Russian’s serve. After bouncing back from a first-set loss to win the second set, Djokovic seemed to have put his early frustrations behind him. He had also found some semblance of rhythm against a player who, as he would say later, “doesn’t give you much rhythm.” Djokovic may not have been playing his best, but he wasn’t pulling the mental ripcord and giving in, either.

Which made what happened next all the more surprising, and, from Medvedev’s perspective, impressive. Medvedev hit a perfectly timed drop shot to even the score at 30-30, then used a series of strong first and second serves to hold. Three games later, Medvedev shrugged off the loss of a 41-shot rally and broke for 3-1. In truth, it was Djokovic who needed to watch out, because Medvedev, an up-and-coming player who was still searching for a signature win, who meant business.

The 23-year-old Medvedev has been around for a few years, but he says he has dedicated himself to the sport in a new way over the last two seasons. Maybe that’s why it still feels as if every time he plays, he reveals a new strength to his game.After watching him beat Stefanos Tsitsipas on Thursday, I came away impressed by Medvedev’s ability to disrupt his opponent’s game, to change paces, to make the other guy do things he doesn’t want to do. But after watching him beat Djokovic today, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, I came away marveling at (a) Medvedev’s patience; he stuck in rallies long enough to force Djokovic to go to his bailout drop shot a lot; and (b) the way Medvedev can control and finish points with his backhand. The shot isn’t a thing of beauty; he almost looks like he’s shoveling the ball from corner to corner. But, as Djokovic said, Medvedev “doesn’t make many mistakes” with it, and he “hits it very low, with depth.” Even if Medvedev isn’t cracking a winner with his backhand, it’s difficult for his opponents to do anything with his rally shot from that side.

By the middle of the third set, it looked as if Djokovic had had enough of trying. With his consistency, his depth, his timely serving, his drop shots, and his surprising speed, Medvedev was essentially mirroring Djokovic’s game, and doing it every bit as well. Djokovic became visibly deflated down the stretch, and finished with 47 unforced errors on a frustratingly breezy afternoon.

“A windy day like today, conditions are changing every single game,” Djokovic said. “It’s kind of tough to find the rhythm. He improved his movement a lot since last year. He definitely deserves to be where he is.”"

Juan Martin del Potro is ready to return from injury once again

Despite injury-plagued year, Nadal remains King of Clay
Nadal, chasing a record-extending 12th Monte Carlo title, broke Grigor Dimitrov's serve on four occasions to defeat the Bulgarian 6-4 6-1.

After recovering from two break points down in his opening service game, Nadal attacked Dimitrov's backhand with power and precision to move into a 3-1 lead.

The 32-year-old Spaniard continued to extract errors from Dimitrov to claim the first set before racing to his 15th quarter-final on the Monte Carlo clay.

Nadal has now recorded 70 wins at the Monte Carlo Country Club. The only other tournament Nadal has achieved more victories is the French Open, where the 11-time winner holds an astonishing 86-2 match-win record.

Second seed Nadal was pleased to have negotiated two top 30 players -- Dimitrov and Roberto Bautista Agut -- and tricky playing conditions on Court Rainier III this week.

""The first two rounds I played more than well enough to win. I had two confident scores against two good players,"" Nadal said.

""The second set (there) were a little bit more mistakes and the wind was even (greater) later in the match. These things are part of the game and just try to be ready for it... You have to adapt. You have to find solutions.""

After struggling to rediscover his rhythm in his opener against Philipp Kohlschreiber, Djokovic looked in complete control as he swept past Taylor Fritz 6-3 6-0.

The 31-year-old Serb quickly adjusted the pace on his groundstrokes to claim three consecutive service breaks and take the opening set.

Fritz failed to offer any kind of resistance in the second set and was ultimately undone by his 28 unforced errors.

It moves Djokovic within three wins of matching Nadal's record haul of 33 ATP Masters 1000 titles and he will next face Russian Daniil Medvedev for a semi-final spot.

Medvedev defeated sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-2 1-6 6-4, beating the Greek youngster for the fourth time in four matches.

""(Daniil) has improved his movement a lot, I think. Obviously his results are showing that he's close to the top 10 rankings,"" said Djokovic.

""He's definitely in the form of his life. He's had a good tournament so far here, winning quite comfortably in the first two matches and then now against Tsitsipas today.

""We have never faced each other on clay. We have faced each other in a close four-setter in Australia this year... I have seen him play. I have hit with him many times. I'm looking forward to it.""

Serb Dusan Lajovic pulled off the biggest upset of the day as he saved seven of the nine break points faced to knock out last year's French Open runner-up Dominic Thiem 6-3 6-3."

The annual fortnight of grass-court tennis is one British sport's crown jewels and Wimbledon's debenture seating is like sporting gold dust, providing its owner unrivaled access at the sport's oldest grand slam tournament.
As well as granting admission to every Centre Court game between 2021 and 2025, the debenture also potentially offers a tidy investment opportunity. One such case in February saw a pass-holder buy a five-year debenture for $66,149, before selling the final two years of the premium ticket for $138,892 three years later.Some ticketholders sell their passes for certain days of the annual championship, while others have been known to resell the pass in its entirety for a bumper price.

""It's prestigious, it's rarefied class but most importantly its quintessentially British.

Barty will play Sabalenka in a crucial reverse singles rubber to open Sunday's action, while Stosur or Daria Gavrilova will play Azarenka in the second match.

If scores are tied, a doubles rubber will determine who hosts the Fed Cup final in November - a trophy that has alluded Australia for 45 years.


""It's massive for all of us ... it's pretty good so far but I want it to be better tomorrow,"" Molik said of the side's fighting effort in front of a rowdy home crowd.

Fognini had beaten Nadal twice before on clay, and also once at the U.S. Open in five sets, but this was arguably the most impressive.

""I have the game to play against him,"" the 13th-seeded Fognini said. ""I had nothing to lose.""

He wasn't concerned if Nadal was out of form.

""That's not the question that I have to answer,"" Fognini said. ""I just say that I played an incredible match.""

Still, the second-ranked Nadal called it ""one of my worst matches in 14 years"" and the 32-year-old Spaniard said it was ""difficult to find an explanation"" for capitulating on his favored clay-court surface.

Yet the defeat could have been even more humiliating for Nadal, who had not lost a set here by 6-0 since the 2005 final — which he went on to win for the first of his record 11 titles.

There is no rest for the weary. The Spaniard is right back to work next week at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell and is set to face a tricky path from the start.

If Nadal is to lift his 12th trophy in Barcelona, he will have earned it. He finds himself in a loaded half of the draw, with a potential path to the final that includes 15th seed Lucas Pouille, 2018 finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas and 2017 runner-up Dominic Thiem.

Nadal, who opens against either Marius Copil or Leonardo Mayer on the familiar clay-courts of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona, could face Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals and Thiem in the semis. He defeated the Greek in straight sets in last year's final, with the Austrian enduring the same fate in the 2017 championship.

Former World No. 3 and longtime rival David Ferrer could square off with Nadal for one last time, with a third-round encounter in the cards. Ferrer, who is playing in the penultimate tournament of his professional career, reached the final four times (2008-09 & 2011-12), falling to his countryman on each occasion. He opens against Mischa Zverev, with Pouille looming in the second round.

Meanwhile, Thiem should not look too far ahead in the draw, with sixth seed Karen Khachanov, #NextGenATP star Frances Tiafoe and home hope Pablo Carreno Busta all residing in his quarter. The third seed will face either Yoshihito Nishioka or Hyeon Chung in his opener. Chung is competing in his first tournament in two months in his recovery from a back injury.

In the bottom half of the draw, second seed Alexander Zverev leads the charge with two former champions posing a threat. Fourth seed and 2014-15 winner Kei Nishikori opens against either Taylor Fritz or Reilly Opelka, with 2010 titlist Fernando Verdasco battling fellow Spanish veteran Feliciano Lopez. They will meet for the 11th time in their 15-year FedEx ATP Head2Head rivalry (tied 5-5).

Romania's top player downed Kristina Mladenovic in the first singles rubber of the semifinal tie in France, 6-3, 6-1 to give the visitors a 1-0 lead.

From 3-3 in the opening set, Halep won nine of the last 10 games overall.

""It was really difficult to start the match because of the emotions. It was really tough to start the game, to start the tie,"" Halep said on-court after the match.

""I'm really happy with the way I plaed in the second set. It was much better. It's difficult to play against Kristina because she cuts the rhythm and I couldn't find my rhythm. In the end, I felt much better, and I can say I was dominating.""

For the match, she broke Mladenovic five times on a staggering 17 opportunities over the course of one hour and 40 minutes, while hitting 19 winners.

The Frenchwoman saved three break points, all from 0-40, in each of her first two service games before Halep finally came through, winning the fifth game of the opening set to 15.

However, Mladenovic would hit back immediately, breaking in the ensuing Halep service game to level, though it proved to be the only break of serve - and only break point - she'd have in the match.

Though both players logged the same total of winners, the French No.2 struggled with her consistency against Halep's defenses on the indoor clay court, as she racked up 35 unforced errors overall.

https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/wta-miami-open-ashleigh-barty-defeats-karolina-pliskova-to-capture-title-2015422,"Ashleigh Barty's transformation is complete after the Australian defeated Czech fifth seed Karolina Pliskova 7-6 (7/1), 6-3 on Saturday to win the biggest singles title of her career at the WTA Miami Open. The 22-year-old Aussie quit tennis five years ago after finding the mental grind of the tour too much to bear, turning to professional cricket in a bid to find sporting happiness. Barty, however, knew she had the tennis skills to compete at the very top and after returning in February 2016, has taken her career to an elite level, culminating in her first-ever WTA Premier Mandatory title to follow on from the US Open doubles crown she won last September.


Barty, a junior Wimbledon winner at age 15, will rise from 11th to number nine in the world rankings and become the first Australian woman since Sam Stosur in June 2013 to crack the top 10.

""It feels like it's a long time ago now since I took the break and since I came back,"" said Barty, who also reached the doubles semi-finals at the Hard Rock Stadium with Victoria Azarenka.

""It's been a few years now, but I certainly feel like I'm a very different person. I feel like I'm a more complete player, I'm a better player.

""I was an average cricketer and I'm becoming a better tennis player.

""I feel like when I play my best, I'm good enough to match it with the very best in the world.""

Barty hit 15 aces and 41 winners compared to 22 from an out-of-sorts Pliskova.

""I had to keep it physical, make as many balls as possible and keep my running shoes on,"" Barty said.

Barty's victory means that for the first time ever there have been 14 different winners in 14 WTA events so far this season.

Pliskova, who will rise to fourth in the rankings despite a disappointing final, badly struggled with her serve and movement, off the pace mentally and physically after reaching the quarter-finals or better in her five prior tournaments this year.

""She played well and I was super tired,"" said the Czech. ""The conditions were different to the night matches I played. For sure I could play better but she went for it in the tie-break.

""The first set was key for the match and one I should have won.It was tough to fight in the second.""

The 27-year-old Czech , who beat Barty 6-4, 6-4 in the round of 16 at last year's US Open, came into the final with 31 aces, most in the women's draw, but she won only 65 per cent of points on her first serve compared to 86 per cent from Barty.

""She served great,"" said Pliskova who defeated Simona Halep in the semi-finals and denied the Romanian the chance to reclaim the world number one ranking.

'Amazing fortnight'

When the Australian double faulted at 1-1 to hand Pliskova an early break, it wasn't the start Barty sought and more errors in the following game allowed Pliskova to extend her lead.

Barty then began to settle down and crisply struck a forehand winner to break Pliskova for the first time.

The Aussie started superbly in the tie-breaker, moving 5-1 ahead before Pliskova hit long to seal the set for Barty, who broke early in the second set to signal it would be her day.

""It's been an amazing fortnight of tennis and it's pretty cool to have played a good match on such a big stage.

""It was always going to be a match of small opportunities so getting the first set was massive.

""There were zero expectations coming into this tournament, I just saw it as an opportunity to get better every day but I have grabbed my chance with both hands."

http://www.tennis-x.com/xblog/2019-04-19/29987.php,"Novak Djokovic suffered his third straight pre-semifinal loss in a Masters on Friday after being stunned by 14th-ranked Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 in the Monte Carlo quarterfinals.

On a breezy day, the top seed struggled on serve getting broken twice in the opening set and three times in the deciding, and in several cases he was leading big in those games.

“He’s got a very solid backhand. He doesn’t make many mistakes from the backhand. He hits it very low with depth. A windy day like today, conditions are changing every single game. It’s kind of tough to find the rhythm, and he doesn’t give you much rhythm,” Djokovic said. “He improved his movement a lot since last year. He definitely deserves to be where he is.”

Djokovic has failed to reach the semifinals at all three Masters events his season.

The 23-year-old Medvedev collected his first win over a World No. 1 and just second Top 10 victory. He had just two career clay match wins at tour level entering the week.

“It’s definitely the best match of my career. Not in terms of level of tennis, but definitely by the result. [It’s my] first Masters 1000 semi-final, beating No. 1 for the first time in my life,” Medvedev said. “Just amazing.”

Even more amazing is Medvedev’s draw. In his first Masters semi, he’ll face another first time final four participant at this level, the 48th-ranked Dusan Lajovic. Djokovic’s countryman edged qualifier Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 7-5 to reach his biggest career semifinal. And he’s done so without dropping a set.

“Right now it’s a relief and I showed to myself that I could do it. The tournament is still not over but I’m extremely happy and satisfied with the way I’ve played this week,” the 28-year-old Lajovic said. “To be in the semifinals of a Masters, such a strong tournament, it’s really a big boost of confidence and I hope that it’s not the only one for the future.

Medvedev beat Lajovic in their only previous meeting last year indoors in Moscow.

Rafael Nadal kept it rolling, though it was a little tougher than expected in a 7-6(1), 6-3 win over fellow-lefty Guido Pella who held a break lead in the first at 4-1.

“It was a very tough first set physically and mentally, too. Losing the first three games with my serve was tough. But I found a way at the right time,” Nadal said. “I was lucky at 4-1, he had two points to be 5-1 and with 5-1 it’s almost impossible. I was lucky to escape that moment and then I played better… I’m very happy to be through. Being in the semifinals again here means a lot to me.”

The 11-time Monte Carlo champion has won his last 18 matches at the event, and overall 15 straight on clay.

Next for Rafa will be someone who has defeated him on his favorite surface, Fabio Fognini. The Italian, though, should count his lucky stars as he found himself down and out a set and a break to the bad against Borna Coric before rallying for a 1-6, 6-3, 6-2.

Fognini won 12 of the last 15 games to deny the Croat.

“I think I was a little bit lucky,” said Fognini, who will face 11-time champion Rafael Nadal in the last four. “I’m happy because I’m playing my second semi-final here. Happy because of course I’ve tried to do my best all week and now it’s time to play with a really good player.”

Nadal leads Fognini 11-3 with all three losses in 2015.

“Everywhere it’s difficult with him. I’ll just try to enjoy this match, try to recover as best I can, eat well, sleep well, play with Federico (son) a little bit before I sleep and tomorrow is another day,” Fognini said. “I’ll try to do my best game. I know that it’s difficult, but I have the game to play against him.”

It’s the 31-year-old Fognini’s third career Masters semifinal, second in Monte Carlo after 2013.

Barty’s 7-6 (7-2) 6-3 defeat of the two-time Australian Open champion showed off all the attributes that have shot the 22-year-old into the top 10, while team captain Alicia Molik thought Stosur played some of the best tennis of her 20-year career on home soil in a gallant 7-5 5-7 6-3 loss to the world No.10."

Serena Williams opens up on US Open controversy.

Hindsight is 20/20 for Serena Williams.
During a “Today Show” appearance on Thursday, the tennis star got candid about her unruly outburst during last year’s US Open.

“Literally just back from having the baby, looking back, I don’t know how I did that,” she said of making her way to the final match exactly one year after giving birth to her daughter, Alexis Ohanian Jr.


“And I had the audacity to be upset when I didn’t win, and I’m like, ‘Why am I angry? This is beyond amazing,’” she said.

Williams, 37, who was on the morning talk show to promote her partnership with Pampers, seems to have moved on from her on-court meltdown in which she blasted umpire Carlos Ramos after he suspected she was taking signals from her coach in the stands.

Williams called Ramos a “thief” and a “liar,” and eventually broke her tennis racket in a one-sided, 6-2, 6-4 loss to Naomi Osaka. She was penalised a game for the outburst.

“You owe me an apology,” Williams yelled to Ramos on live television. “I’ve never cheated in my life. I have a daughter and stand for what’s right for her"
https://www.tennis.com.au/news/2019/03/31/rogowska-takes-canberra-title,"Unseeded Olivia Rogowska took the ACT Claycourt International #2 title on Sunday with a 7-6(6) 6-3 victory over top seed and world No.136 Priscilla Hon.

Hon, who was in dominant form all week and was yet to drop a set on her way to the final, came out firing, breaking early before Rogowska surged to a 5-3 lead. However, Hon fought back to take the first set to a tiebreak.

Rogowska stood firm to take the first set, and while there were multiple breaks in the second, it was again the Victorian who held her nerve to close out the match.

“Priscilla’s been playing extremely well so I knew it was going to be very tough today,” Rogowska said. “I played well on the important points and that’s really what got me through. After that first set, which could have gone either way, I was just really happy to close it out.”

The 27-year-old now boasts an impressive 17-2 record from her last four outings in Canberra, which includes winning the Apis Canberra International 2017 title – and a semifinal showing last week.

“Coming into these two weeks my goal was to be as professional as I could with my routine, be as tough as possible, and try and get as many matches as I could. I achieved all of that and its great preparation for the rest of the year,” she said."

Margaret Amritraj, popularly known as Maggie and mother of former Indian tennis players Anand, Vijay and Ashok, breathed her last on Saturday morning after a prolonged illness. She was 92 and is survived by her three sons and their families.

A former tennis player herself, Maggie was instrumental in getting her sons into tennis and was a multi-faceted personality.

Speaking to The Hindu, Anand, the oldest of the Amritraj brothers and a former India Davis Cup player and captain, said, “She was the biggest influence in my life, not just in tennis. Couldn’t have asked for a better mother. She has been the most constant figure in my life, even in the last 10 years, when she has not been able to travel. I am sure both my brothers will say the same.

“She was extremely proud of all her sons. It is a huge loss and a huge void in our lives. We always knew she was there. Even if she wasn’t well or she wasn’t speaking well, we knew she was there. Now that’s gone.”


Despite a burn accident in 1964 and a severe injury to her right hand in 1968, Maggie played a key role in guiding her sons even as she ran her own business. Nobody has captured this better than Vijay, India’s most successful singles player, in his autobiography."

Berdych, who was sidelined for the final six months of 2018 battling a back injury, opened the 2019 season reaching the Doha final where he fell to Roberto Bautista Agut.

The 33-year-old Czech has posted a 12-6 record this season.

Berdych, who lost to Lopez in Indian Wells, was 2012 Madrid runner-up to Roger Federer.

The 48th-ranked Serb will face the winner from the other semi-final between 11-time champion Rafael Nadal and Italy's 13th seed Fabio Fognini.

The match was played in a distracting, swirling conditions, with Lajovic making a recovery from 5-1 down after changing strategy when his Russian opponent had the upper hand.

Lajovic ran off 10 straight games to claim the opening set in an hour and take a 4-0 lead in the second.

""I was completely out of rhythm, to start. It was the worst nightmare, being 5-1 down,"" Lajovic said.

""It was impossible for us to play real tennis,"" he added. ""I started moving to the ball.

""Before I had been waiting to see where it was going, this was the turning point.

""I'm still unaware of reaching the final, but I'm enjoying it,"" added the player who has not dropped a set all week.

Osaka finds herself in her second straight Grand Slam final at just 21 years old. After winning the US Open in September, Osaka is now trying to win the Australian Open as well. Her opponent will be the eighth-ranked Petra Kvitova, who ended the run of Danielle Collins to make it to the final. 

Australian Open women's final: No. 4 Naomi Osaka vs. No. 8 Petra Kvitova
Date: Saturday, Jan. 26
Time: 3 a.m.
Location: Rod Laver Arena -- Melbourne, Australia
Watch: ESPN
Stream: Watch ESPN
Kvitova has swept her way through the tournament, and she's yet to lose a set. With that being said, she's played only one ranked opponent to this point: No. 15 Ashleigh Barty. Since her first-round win, Osaka has only played ranked opponents.

However, you play who you play, so for these two women it's a clean slate. Osaka has improved as time has gone on -- she had an outrageous 15 aces against Pliskova -- and she seems to do better with pressure, as we saw against Serena Williams in September. Going for back-to-back majors is a ton of pressure, but she's proven to be more than capable.

Kvitova is playing for plenty herself. ""It means everything,"" she said of going to the finals after beating Collins, per WTA Tennis. ""This is why I work very hard to be in the finals of tournaments and the finals of majors.""


Kvitova's last major win was in 2014 when she won Wimbledon. Both of her Grand Slam wins have been in England, so this is an opportunity to add another trophy to the case for the 28-year-old.

https://sports.yahoo.com/halep-rides-wave-emotion-fed-cup-semi-finals-182048597--ten.html,"Simona Halep's dream of adding a maiden Fed Cup title to her Roland Garros breakthrough triumph was on a knife-edge Saturday as Romania and France ended the opening day of their semi-final locked at 1-1.

World number two Halep outclassed Kristina Mladenovic 6-3, 6-1 in the northern French city of Rouen where 1,000 Romanian fans drowned out the larger home support.

French number one Caroline Garcia, the world number 21, then made a point of cupping her ear to the Romanian fans after easing to a 6-3, 6-3 win over 30th-ranked Mihaela Buzarnescu as the opening day ended all square.

""I have won a Grand Slam, been world number one and now this is the next goal,"" Halep told fedcup.com after her eighth successive win in the tournament which last saw Romania make the final in 1973.

""It was hard to control my emotions but here in this arena, there are so many Romanians that I felt we were playing at home.

""They were louder than the French and the energy they gave us was amazing.""

French captain Julien Benneteau took a gamble on Mladenovic, who reached the top 10 in late 2017 but had won only 24 of her last 70 matches to slip to 66 in the world.

Mladenovic had won three of her five encounters with Halep but on Saturday struggled in her service games and did not have the tools to stop the Romanian steamroller.

Garcia then claimed a third win in three singles rubbers since she returned from a two-year exile after falling out with her Fed Cup teammates.

Buzarnescu was unable to ride the wave of Romanian support and remains without a singles win in the Fed Cup in seven years.

In the other semi-final in Brisbane, Australia and Belarus also shared the spoils with world number nine Ashleigh Barty sweeping past Victoria Azarenka after Aryna Sabalenka had ground down veteran Samantha Stosur.

While Belarus are bidding to reach the final for the second time in three attempts, after being beaten by the United States in 2017, Australia are targeting their first decider in 26 years.

It's been an even longer wait between titles, with the last of Australia's seven victories coming in 1974.

""I'm so proud of the level of tennis the girls put on today,"" said Australia captain Alicia Molik.

""It's a great position we're in and we are prepared for a fifth rubber if necessary.""

An ice cool Barty, who has rocketed through the ranks, breaking into the top 10 with her win at the Miami Open this month, proved too much for tour doubles partner Azarenka at the Pat Rafter Arena, winning 7-6 (7/2), 6-3."

Kyrgios displayed what some have called a lack of respect for the chair umpire Gianluca Moscarella, when he congratulated the Italian's controlling of the match in a sarcastic manner after receiving a point penalty during the clash.However, Bouchard, a former doubles partner of Kyrgios, jumped to his defence after the loss to Coric and stressed the Australian's antics were overall positive for the game of tennis.

""How is he not good for the sport? He has ESPN talking about tennis."" Bouchard posted on Instagram.

While there's been plenty of criticism from opposing players like Rafael Nadal about the way he plays the game and his overall presentation on the court, Kyrgios received some support from Australian tennis legend Pat Cash, who himself had problems with authority during his storied career which saw him win Wimbledon in 1987.

Cash said Kyrgios needed to stay true to himself also defendeding his use of underarm serves against Serb Dusan Lajovic this week and moreover against Rafael Nadal in Acapulco, where the Australian won the title."

Part of Great Britain’s five-woman team, bidding to return to the World Group for the first time since 1992, the 20-year-old Briton may find herself left on the bench by team captain Anne Keothavong. Johanna Konta and Katie Boulter established themselves as the singles players in Bath – both winning all four of their respective matches against Slovenia, Greece, Hungary and Serbia – while Heather Watson, who missed the tie through injury, and Harriet Dart are both ranked considerably higher than Swan in doubles. It could, in many ways, have been more beneficial for her to skip this tie altogether and focus instead on herself. After all, there are no rankings points – the currency all tennis players trade in – on offer in the Fed Cup. In an isolated sport such as tennis, where one has to look after him or herself, who could really blame her for swapping the Fed Cup bench for the opportunity to get some matches under her belt at a host of tournaments on offer this week? Of course, the thought has never crossed her mind. ‘For me, it’s never a difficult decision,’ Swan tells Metro.co.uk and the Love Tennis Podcast. ‘If I get picked for Fed Cup then I’m going to be there unless there’s something crazy that happens like I’m really sick or something like that.

https://montrealgazette.com/sports/tennis/montreal-phenom-auger-aliassime-has-special-energy-intensity-coaches,"Minutes after speaking with reporters about a tough semifinal loss at the Miami Open last month, Félix Auger-Aliassime returned to the court to work on his game.

The decision didn’t surprise those who know the rising Canadian tennis star best.

“It was maybe a little bit of therapy for him. … I think it was a good reaction,” said longtime coach Guillaume Marx, noting Auger-Aliassime wasn’t happy with his serve in the two-tiebreak loss to world No. 10 John Isner of the U.S.

“He doesn’t kick back and relax too much. He wants to get better. We can see it every day.” Playing for the first time since the loss to the big-hitting Isner, Auger-Aliassime got back on the winning track Tuesday with a 7-5, 7-6 (5) win over Argentine qualifier Juan Ignacio Londero on clay at the Monte Carlo Masters. He’ll face a tougher test on Wednesday against world No. 3 Alexander Zverev of Germany in the second round of the ATP Tour Masters 1000 event.

Auger-Aliassime has been getting better all year. The teen, who finished 2018 ranked 108th in the world, vaulted to No. 33 after becoming the youngest semifinalist in Miami tournament history. He’s the youngest player in the top 100.

Tennis has long been a way of life for Auger-Aliassime.

He and his older sister Malika were raised in a suburb of Quebec City where his mom, Marie Auger, worked as a teacher and his dad, Sam Aliassime — who came to Canada from Togo in West Africa — runs a tennis academy.

Auger-Aliassime first picked up a racket around age five. His dad coached him until he was 12 when Félix moved to Montreal to train at the National Tennis Centre.

He started working with Marx soon after. The coach remembers a lanky kid who was already hitting the ball “quite hard.”

“What was special was the energy and the intensity in what he was doing,” Marx said."

When the American lined up opposite Aussie Ajla Tomljanovic in the third round of the Charleston Open she was out to snap a disappointing streak that had seen her reach the fourth round of a tournament just once in her previous six attempts.

After early exits at Indian Wells and the Miami Open, Stephens was desperate to stay alive in Charleston. She lost the opening set and was down 3-0 in the second but dug deep to take the match to a decider before rounding it out in the third for an incredible 4-6 6-4 6-4 win.

“For the first time in a long time I really was like, I gotta beat this girl,” Stephens said in her post-match press conference. “Like, I wanted to be out there, and I was really fighting, and I didn’t care what it took.

“But you guys (reporters) obviously see me play a lot, and I was running to the baseline on the changeovers when I was down 3-0.

“I was like, ‘OK, I gotta figure out a way’ and I definitely think my attitude is what won me the match today.”

Quizzed on why she had a burning desire to come out on top against Tomljanovic, perhaps more-so than in recent matches, Stephens shocked herself — and the reporters in front of her — with her brutally honest response.

“I’m tired of f***ing losing. S**t sucks!” she said before realising she forgot to filter herself.

“Oh my God,” Stephens added as she put her hand up to her mouth, breaking into a fit of laughter and clapping. “Oh man.”

Murray announced last month at the Australian Open that he would compete in the season’s first major but might never be able to play again. He lost in the first round in Melbourne and had hip resurfacing surgery about two weeks ago.

Judy Murray, Andy’s mother and former coach, told The Associated Press that she doesn’t think her son is done just yet.

“I don’t think we know anything, for sure nobody does,” Judy Murray said at the Rio Open, the biggest tennis tournament in South America. “But I know that he would do everything that he possibly can to give himself a chance to play again.

“I think he had the same operation as Bob Bryan after the U.S. Open, and he was playing doubles again, at Australian Open. But doubles is a very different physical proposition as singles. I think, right now, (we have to) wait and see.”"
https://www.usta.com/en/home/stay-current/eastern/eastern-hall-of-fame.html,"Join us for the 32nd Annual USTA Eastern Tennis Hall of Fame Celebration to benefit the Junior Tennis Foundation (JTF) Grant and Scholarship Programs.

 

Since its inception, the JTF has awarded more than $2 million in grants and scholarships for aspiring junior and adaptive players, as well as NJTLs throughout the Eastern Section. The funds raised from this celebratory event will afford many worthy and motivated children with incredible opportunities to attend tennis camps, sectional and national competitions and educational workshops that ultimately cultivate the love and prosperity of our beloved sport. 

 

USTA Eastern and the JTF are thrilled to welcome our 2019 inductees who have played pivotal roles in Eastern’s tennis community: Kit Byron, Bid Goswami, Nick Greenfield, and Carole Wright. 

 

Kit Byron

A renowned tennis coach in the Eastern section, Kit Byron helped develop and transform the games of over 150 juniors who would go on to become Eastern, USTA and WTA-ranked players, including former world No. 10 and two-time French Open Quarterfinalist Kathleen Horvath and French Open Quarterfinalists Terry Phelps and Melissa Brown. Today, Byron oversees 600 juniors and 450 adult players at Rye Racquet, the club he has owned since 1995. In addition to coaching, Byron served two terms as a USTA Eastern vice president and sat on the USTA's Junior Tennis Council.

 

Bid Goswami

Bid Goswami served 37 seasons as the head coach of Columbia University men's tennis. Among the most successful coaches in college tennis history, Goswami has led Columbia to 13 NCAA tournament appearances and 13 Ivy League Championship titles—including the last five from 2014-18. Under Goswami, the Lions have advanced to the Sweet 16 seven times in the last ten years: Three times in the NCAA tournament and four in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoor Championships. From 1977 to 2012, Goswami also held the position of Tennis Director and Head Professional at Westchester Country Club in Rye, N.Y.

 

Nick Greenfield

Nick Greenfield is a former ranked USTA Eastern junior who went on to play No. 1 singles for Lafayette College, where he won four individual conference titles and led his team to three team conference championships. After graduating, he founded Eastern Roundup Magazine, a publication with every USTA Eastern junior tournament match result, along with photos, articles of interest for junior tennis players and their families.  Nick also worked for three years as a member of the USTA Eastern staff.

 

Carole Wright

Ranked No. 1 in the East for seven years (and as high as No. 16 nationally), Carole Wright won the New York State Championship title three times, the USTA National Indoor Championships twice, the Canadian Indoor Championships once, and medaled in the Maccabi Games. After retiring as a player, she founded the Wright Tennis Center with the Irish Lawn Tennis Center in 1984 to help grow the sport in Ireland. Since 1992, she has served as the co-director of All City Junior Tennis and Sports Camp at the Roosevelt Island Racquet Club in New York, N.Y.  "

The 21-year-old Japanese-Haitian had just won the Australian Open, beating a former world number one and two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. The win in Melbourne was her second Grand Slam after beating Serena Williams in the US Open final a few months ago. 

She overcame Kvitova's spirited fightback with a 7-6, 5-7, 6-4 win on Saturday.

A year ago, Osaka was 72nd in the world rankings. On Monday, she will be the new queen of tennis, rising to the number one slot and becoming the youngest top-ranked female player since 2010.

On the court, there was no shrieking, no jumping for joy and no gasping after she won the championship point. From the baseline, she ran to the net, bowed to Kvitova before the hugs and handshakes, bowed to the crowd before walking to her chair to put her rackets away."

Andreescu defied the odds to become the first wildcard to be crowned Indian Wells champion earlier this month, but there will be no Sunshine Double after the 18-year-old Canadian shook hands at 6-1, 2-0 down on Monday.A right shoulder injury halted the rising star's incredible run and ensured Kontaveit will face either Caroline Wozniacki or Hsieh Su-wei in the quarterfinals.

Kontaveit took charge following a rain delay of around 90 minutes and Andreescu called for a medical timeout after losing the first set.

It was all over just 56 minutes into the contest on Court 1, with Andreescu deciding she was unable to continue."

The Buckeyes are currently 24-2 and 9-0 in conference play. Ohio State returns home after a successful road trip where they defeated Northwestern and followed it up with a victory over No. 15 Illinois.

Ohio State has regained their No. 1 ranking in the latest ITA National Rankings after spending a week at No. 2. The Buckeyes are on a eight-match win streak and are coming off a marquee win over the Fighting Illini. In addition to being No. 1 in the nation as a team, the Buckeyes have four players nationally ranked in singles, and four tandems nationally ranked in doubles.

For the ninth-consecutive week, junior JJ Wolf has sat atop the singles national rankings at No. 1. Following Wolf is John McNally at No. 23, Kyle Seelig at No. 56 and James Trotter at No. 103. Big performances from McNally and Wolf over the weekend were crucial in the Buckeyes victories.

In doubles, the senior tandem of Martin Joyce and Hunter Tubert lead the pack at No. 9 in the national rankings. Joyce/Tubert are 13-4 so far this season. Following the seniors are Kyle Seelig and Alex Kobelt at No. 28, JJ Wolf and Martin Joyce at No. 30 and the tandem of James Trotter and Alex Kobelt at No. 45. No ranked, but quietly having an excellent season is the duo of John McNally and Hunter Tubert. The two are currently 18-0 in doubles play in 2019

On Friday the Buckeyes will take on the Purdue Boilermakers. Purdue enters the match with a record of 9-11 and are coming off wins over No. 50 Iowa and Nebraska. Purdue is led by Athell Bennet, who is currently 12-3 in singles in 2019. Last season, the Buckeyes traveled to West Lafayette and defeated the Boilermakers 4-0.

On Sunday, Ohio State will host the Indiana Hoosiers. The Hoosiers enter the weekend 13-9 overall and 6-3 in the Big Ten. Indiana most recently defeated No. 50 Iowa, St. Louis and Nebraska. In singles, Indiana is led by No. 68 Antonio Cembellin, who is 23-8 overall for the 2018-19 season. In doubles play, the Hoosiers are led by the ranked tandem of Carson Haskins and Brandon Lam at No. 51. Last season, the Buckeyes traveled to Bloomington and defeated the Hoosiers 5-2.

Sunday’s match against Indiana marks Ohio State’s Senior Day. We are honoring two extraordinary gentlemen in Hunter Tubert and Martin Joyce. Martin Joyce, a 2018 NCAA All-American in doubles, has been a staple in the success for the Buckeyes over the last four years, and is a nominee for the Big Ten Medal of Honor Award, given to one student-athlete from the graduating class of each university who had “attained the greatest proficiency in athletics and scholastic work. Hunter Tubert, a member of the 2019 NCAA All-Tournament team for doubles, was an OSU Scholar Athlete for all four years and a member of the 2017 Big Ten Doubles Championship tandem. Tubert, a defined leader of this Ohio State team, has shown excellence both on and off the court, and that includes a senior season that saw him collect 17+ wins in singles, shattering his previous best of 8. Ohio State has been lucky to have Joyce and Tubert in their squad and at their school these last four years, and the two will both go on to do big things in the future. Hunter, Martin, we thank you."

With the match tied at 3-3, it was Chabut at No. 5 that provided the match clincher, beating Ed Pudney, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-1. In was also Chabut that teamed with Mikus Losbergs to win at No. 1 doubles by a 6-3 score.

With the victory, Sacramento State improved to 6-10 overall and 4-2 in the Big Sky. In the process, the Hornets moved into a three-way tie for second place in the conference standings with Southern Utah and Idaho State. Sacramento State still has four conference matches to play, including this Saturday at Montana State.

Sacramento State is now 4-0 in Big Sky road matches, including wins at Eastern Washington, Idaho and Portland State. Of the Hornets' six conference matches, five have been decided by 4-3 scores (the team is 3-2 in those outcomes).

Montana, which lost for just the second time at home, dropped to 6-11 and 3-3 in league. The win for the Hornets was their first in Missoula since the 2008 season. Since that time, Sacramento State has dropped four straight when playing Montana on the road.

Joining Losbergs/Chabut with a doubles win were Hermont Legaspi and Dom Miller who helped the Hornets pick up what turned out to be a huge doubles point. After the Hornets and Grizzlies split the first two doubles matches, Legaspi and Miller were tied at 6-6, and immediately trailed 4-2 in the tiebreaker. However, the tandem won five of the next six points to win the tiebreaker, 7-5, and give the Hornets the point.

Montana won at Nos. 2 and 3 singles to take a 2-1 lead, but Losbergs won his match at No. 1, 6-4, 7-6 (5), and Gjerdaker won at No. 4 by a 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 score. Gjerdaker was tied at 3-3 in the third set, before winning each of the last three games to claim victory. Losbergs trailed, 5-2, in his second set tiebreaker before rattling off five straight points to win. That gave the Hornets a 3-2 lead with matches at Nos. 5 and 6 still to play. Donald Hall lost at No. 6 in a very close match, 7-5, 7-6 (3), setting up Chabut's three-set victory.

Putintseva, a 5ft 4in ball of energy ranked 38, is the severest threat to the GB team's hopes of returning to the elite World Group level of the main team competition in women's tennis.

Fabio Fognini failed to take a set off Alexander Zverev in their first two FedEx ATP Head2Head meetings. But the Italian broke through in style against the 21-year-old on Thursday at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters.

In front of an energised crowd on Court Rainier III, Fognini secured 75 per cent of first-serve points (30/40) to defeat Zverev 7-6(6), 6-1 in 90 minutes. Fognini has now reached five ATP Masters 1000 quarter-finals, which include his run to the semi-finals at the Monte-Carlo Country Club in 2013 (l. to Djokovic).

Fognini entered the tournament with seven losses in his past eight tour-level matches and trailed Andrey Rublev 4-6, 1-4 in his first-round match. But after his first win over a Top 3 opponent since his victory over then-World No. 1 Andy Murray at the 2017 Internazionali BNL d’Italia, Fognini is one win away from a return to the last four in the Principality.

The World No. 18 will meet ninth seed Borna Coric in the quarter-finals. Fognini defeated Coric in their only previous FedEx ATP Head2Head clash at the 2014 Plava Laguna Croatia Open Umag.

The Croatian advanced to his second straight Masters 1000 quarter-final after one hour and 41 minutes, saving all three break points he faced to beat Pierre-Hugues Herbert of France 6-4, 6-2. Coric also reached the last eight at the Miami Open presented by Itau last month, beating Nick Kyrgios in three sets before a straight-sets loss to #NextGenATP Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime."

""It was a great team effort today from start to finish,"" said the Scott Mead '77 Head Coach for Harvard Men's Tennis Andrew Rueb. ""Our doubles have gotten better each week, and it is a credit to our guys for making the adjustments.""

Fighting back from an early deficit, Harvard claimed the doubles points to go 1-0 over Memphis to open the match. The Tigers took the first point, downing Christopher Morrow and Steven Sun on court three, 6-3. No. 34 doubles pair Andy Zhou and Logan Weber quickly rebounded to even the match for the Crimson, taking down Memphis' top pair in a quick 6-4 victory. Locked at 6-6 on court two, Robert Wrzesinski and Brian Shi ultimately clinched the point for Harvard after breaking down the Tigers.

Moving into singles, Brian Shi made quick work of Memphis, handedly defeating their No. 3, 6-1, 6-0, to push Harvard out to a 2-0 lead. Harris Walker followed shortly after, running past the Tigers on court four to take the Crimson's third point in a 6-3, 6-2 victory. Undefeated first-year Steven Sun claimed yet another singles victory, clinching the match for Harvard with a 6-4, 7-5 decision over Memphis.

""In singles, the first-year trio of Brian, Harry and Steven pushed us over the finish line,"" said Rueb. ""Andy also put in a great week of training and it showed in his play today.""

Harvard Highlights

The Crimson have had a stellar season to date, coming in at 14-6 on the season and 2-1 in Ivy League play. One of those six losses was in New Haven, a 4-3 thriller that saw Yale come out on top thanks to a 3-1 comeback. Since then, Harvard has been one of the hottest teams in the nation, having won seven consecutive matches before a 4-3 loss to a ranked Princeton team. The Crimson are coached by Traci Green.

Dartmouth comes into the weekend seeking their first Ivy League win, currently standing at 3-14 overall and 0-3 in Ivy League play. The previous match between the two teams also ended in the Bulldogs favor; Yale won 4-1 to take 5th place in the ECAC Indoor Championships in early February. The Big Green are coached by Bob Dallis.

Sunday will also be the last home match of the season for the Bulldogs and the last ever home match for seniors Caroline Amos and Amy Yang. Both will be honored prior to Sunday's match for their accomplishments and contributions to the team over the past four seasons.

She represented a bright spot of a 6-1 setback to Missouri Valley Conference foe UNI at Black Hawk Tennis Club in Waterloo, Iowa.     

How It Happened

Sysouvanh teamed up with sophomore Claire Czerwonka (Kenosha, Wis. / Saint Joseph Catholic Academy) for a 7-5 victory over Reghan Lynch and Claudia Toledo at No. 1 doubles. The Panthers (4-5, 1-2) took the No. 2 and No. 3 matches to win the doubles point.
Sysouvanh battled her way back from an early hole against Harri Proudfoot at No. 3 singles. The Valpo junior lost the opening set 4-6, but then prevailed 7-5, 6-2 to nail down the match.
Freshman Isabella Schoolcraft (Bargersville, Ind. / Center Grove) again played well, taking Daisy Phillips to a third set at No. 4 singles. Phillips came out on top 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.
Another three-set affair came at No. 6, where Jordan Kopfer (Eagan, Minn. / Eastview) grabbed the first set but eventually fell to Olivia Fain 3-6, 6-1, 6-3.
Czerwonka and Lynch engaged in a tight battle at the top singles spot, but Lynch prevailed 7-5, 7-5.

Inside the Match

Sysouvanh recorded her fifth overall win of the season with four of them coming in dual matches. She gained her first MVC triumph of the year while improving to 2-1 in the last three matches and 3-2 in the last five.

Czerwonka is up to 26 career doubles victories as only a sophomore after she racked up 15 a year ago.
This represented Valpo’s final road match of the regular season.

Wet mouth sounds, dry crunching sounds, and rustling bag sounds nearly matched the volume of tennis ball sounds on the broadcast.

The loud eater would dutifully chime in every three points or so to mumble some commentary, then return to his trusty bag of whatevers.

OU (15-10, 2-5 Big 12) tallied singles wins from Jake Van Emburgh and Alex Bakshi, but fell short to the Longhorns.  

“Today we had our chances to take the match,” said OU head coach Nick Crowell. “We played good doubles again and put ourselves right there in position, we just need to do a few things better and we will get that point next time. 

Our goal is to keep getting better moving forward into NCAAs. This team has a lot of heart and resiliency and I’m excited to get back on the courts these next two weeks and get back to work.” 

In doubles, Van Emburgh and Ferran Calvo came away with a win on court two, but the Sooners dropped the opening point. Van Emburgh and Calvo took down Colin Markes and Leonardo Telles 6-3. After tying the match at every game up to 3-all, the Sooners won the next three games, sealed by a Van Emburgh service winner, to capture court two. 

No. 53 Bakshi and Stefano Tsorotiotis fell to No. 6 Harrison Scott and Christian Sigsgaard 6-3 on court one. At the No. 3 line, Max Stewart and Spencer Papa were defeated by Chih Chi Huang and Yuya Ito 7-5. 

In singles, No. 63 Bakshi pulled off an upset at the two spot, taking down No. 7 Ito in straight sets. After trailing early in the first, Bakshi rallied to take the set 6-4, then carried his momentum into the second where he never trailed to win 6-3.  

“Alex got a huge win for the Sooners. His opponent is so tough and Alex showed what he can do when he is playing his game,” said Crowell.  

No. 80 Van Emburgh routed No. 73 Telles on court two. The sophomore jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first set before closing it out 6-4. Van Emburgh trailed 2-1 to start the second but took control and allowed Telles just one more game to win 6-3. 

“Jake stepped up again and showed why he is one of the toughest competitors in the nation. His opponent is a senior with a lot of experience and Jake really took it to him. “ 

No. 36 Papa fell to No. 9 Sigsgaard 6-4, 6-3 on court one. Beiler was defeated by Markes 6-4, 6-3 at the No. 5 line. On court six, Tsorotiotis fell to Rodrigo Banzer 6-2, 6-1.  

When play was halted, Calvo was headed to a third set with No. 53 Scott on court three. Calvo took the first set 6-4 before Scott claimed set two 6-3.

This week on tennis Twitter, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga shares a snap of his team, Frances Tiafoe makes an off-court appearance, and Eugenie Bouchard snaps back with the truth.

Tennis Twitter is a place where hot shots, amazing aces and the tennis community can come together and connect. It is also a place where rumors are quick to run rampant. And this week they have, when a Twitter account falsely reported that Genie Bouchard, who recently pulled out of two tournaments, was taking “an indeterminate break.”

Bouchard, who has a strong social media presence, shut down the rumors quickly.


Another player who isn’t taking a break is three-time US Open quarterfinalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. On Thursday, the Frenchman shared a snap of him and his son, Sugar, stretching before hitting the courts in Marrakech, Morocco.


While Tsonga has advanced to the quarterfinals, Madison Keys made it all the way to the winner’s circle this past Sunday, taking her fourth title in Charleston after defeating Caroline Wozniacki, 7-6, 6-3, at the Volvo Car Open.

LTA coach Matt James tweeted the clip from an outside green clay court and added: ""He’s back....ish #murray"".Scot Murray can be seen knocking up with Estonia's world No 15 Anett Kontavei and Britain's Canadian-born starlet Emma Raducanu, 16.

And the big question is whether former world No1 Murray is still pain free.

Just last week he revealed he had played his first round of golf without discomfort for six years.

That suggested his recovery from hip resurfacing surgery in January and April - following persistent injury problems in recent years - is going as smoothly as possible.

Murray will surely take huge encouragement from USA doubles expert Bob Bryan, 40, successfully returning from the same operation.

And tennis fans tweeted their delight at Murray's Wimbo outing today, one saying: ""Seeing Andy pain free and hitting a tennis ball is so blooming good to see.""

Murray himself said last month: “I want to continue playing.

“I said that in Australia. The issue is I don’t know if it’s possible."

https://southerncaliforniatennis.org/youth-tennis/qualifier-hohmann-repeat-winner-navarro-win-adidas-easter-bowl-titles/,"A qualifier winning his ninth match in nine days and a repeat Adidas Easter Bowl winner highlighted the final day of action at the 52nd annual Adidas Easter Bowl on Sunday at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.

LSU recruit and Ron Hohmann of Oyster Bay, N.Y., became the first qualifier in Easter Bowl history to run through the entire draw and end it with a title as the 17-year-old beat No. 3-seeded Martin Damm, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, to capture the USTA Gold ball in the Boys’ ITF 18-and-under division at the USTA Spring Nationals.

Charleston, S.C., 17-year-old Emma Navarro added a second USTA Gold Ball to her vast collection as she added the singles title to the doubles she won Saturday in taking out 14-year-old No. 14 seeded Robin Montgomery of Washington D.C., 6-0, 7-6 (2), for the Girls’ ITF 18s title. Navarro became the eighth girls in Easter Bowl history to win the Girls’ 16s, then come back to also win the 18s.Hohmann receives three valuable wild cards into future events, including one into this home-state US Open Juniors in September.

“I didn’t really think if I win, I get this, if I lose I get this,” said Hohmann, who will also get wild cards into an ATP $80,000 Challenger and a ITF World Tennis Tour $25,000 event. “During the match I had no thought about it. Maybe on match point I did. Match point I was thinking about it a little bit.”

In the third set, and receiving serve up 3-2, Damm couldn’t convert on two breaks points as Hohmann found a way to hold for 3-all. Damm said there wasn’t much he could do as Hohmann never stopped hitting out and going for winners.

“Those winners were coming left and right and there is really nothing you could do about that,” said Damm, who won the 16s at the USTA National Hardcourts in Kalamazoo, Mich., last year. “He played a really good match, and I didn’t play my best match. I think he was just playing free. He was making winners from every part of the court. There were so many things I could have done differently but it’s already in the past and there will be other matches and I look forward to my next one on Tuesday [in Carson].”

Damm received the USTA Silver ball and will also get wild cards into a $25,000 and $15,000 ITF pro event.

Hohmann said he wasn’t sure how his body would hold up. He signaled for his coach who joined him on the courts at the end of the second set. “I literally told him I’m so tired and I can’t move and he told me the game plan of what to do and he told me to be consistent and don’t waste your energy on stupid things,” Hohmann said. “I just conserved my energy very well.”

Hohmann was able to handle the 6-foot-6 ½ Damm’s lefty serve when he needed to most. “Every time I broke him I made sure to get the serve in the court, but he has a great serve,” he said. “It was really tough to return.”

After dominating an overwhelmed Montgomery to win the first set at love, Navarro found herself down 2-5 in the second before playing her consistent, steady game to come back and force a tiebreaker. She had won two tiebreakers at 7-1 earlier in the tournament and dominated the final one starting the breaker with an ace.

“I’m trying to figure out why I’m doing so good in tiebreakers,” said Navarro, who has a wild card into singles and doubles on clay at her hometown WTA Premier Level Volvo Car Open this week. “I focus well in tiebreakers and I know it’s high stakes and it’s important and it matters.”"

Kyrgios was playing a doubles match alongside American Taylor Fritz in Miami on Sunday (AEDT), with the pair defeated 10-8 in a super tiebreaker by Portugal’s Joao Sousa and Argentina's Guido Pella.

Kyrgios was reportedly unhappy with a number of calls during the match and he exploded at the umpire after the final point.

""What the f--- is wrong with you? You're a disgrace. Absolute f---ing disgrace,"" Kyrgios yelled at the umpire, before smashing his racquet and continuing his rant in the direction of fans. The rant stunned even hardened tennis followers, who have seen plenty of volatile behaviour from Kyrgios during his young career.

Jones unloaded on Kyrgios on the TODAY Show, saying the 23-year-old Aussie needed to be sidelined by the ATP Tour.

""Really ugly stuff again from Kyrgios,"" Jones said.

""It just begs so many questions on so many fronts. Why is it that tennis is probably the only sport in the world where the participants can freely abuse the umpires and get off scot free? We've seen it for decades now and it continues to happen.

""And as for Kyrgios, I mean, how many second chances do you give this kid? When the summer was on and we had him in the commentary box for Channel Nine, butter wouldn't melt in his mouth.

""But bottom line is, he's a foul-mouthed little brat and I just think, no more second chances. He should be banned for three months on the back of that."""
https://www.yenisafak.com/en/sports/tennis-messi-backing-pique-in-new-davis-cup-venture-3474681,"Lionel Messi is one of the investors in the Davis Cup Finals in Madrid later this year, according to Barcelona team mate Gerard Pique whose Kosmos company has been instrumental in a revamp for the historic tennis competition.

Pique's investment firm Kosmos has backed the new format to the tune of $3 billion over 25 years and will jointly run the competition alongside the International Tennis Federation (ITF).

The inaugural 18-nation finals, which have replaced the 16-nation World Group played throughout the year, will take place at Madrid's La Caja Magica (Magic Box) stadium on Nov. 18-24.

Speaking before Thursday's draw ceremony, Pique confirmed Argentina forward and fellow tennis fan Messi, who already has a stake in Kosmos, was involved.

""Leo knows more than anyone about this because he is involved in Kosmos,"" Pique was quoted as saying by British media on Friday.

""He is a partner, he is part of the Kosmos family, he likes tennis. We have a relationship of 18 years since he arrived at the club and I always try to share with him things I'm thinking, he loves to be part of it and he wanted to be part of it.""

Pique's involvement in the ITF's 119-year-old team competition has drawn scorn in some quarters, with former world number one Lleyton Hewitt, who will captain Australia at the event, questioning his credentials.

Swiss great Roger Federer even suggested the competition was in danger of becoming the ""Pique Cup"".

""I hate it, because it's not about me and I don't want my name on the competition,"" Pique said.

""Davis Cup history is so big. I hope we can change this opinion. After a few years, I hope they go back and say 'We were wrong, Davis Cup is more alive than ever'.

""I respect the opinion of Lleyton, he was a great player. I can understand that when a footballer comes in the tennis world it can seem a little bit awkward or strange, but at the end of the day I'm not going to be changing the rules of tennis.""

Pique, 32, also said he was too busy trying to help Barcelona win La Liga and the Champions League than meddling too much in the ITF's flagship tournament.

""I don't want to be distracted because I have another job, which is to play football. It helps me be focused, more concentrated and not to make mistakes on the pitch because otherwise I know there will be criticism,"" he said in the Daily Mail.

The Davis Cup Finals, which will offer a large prize money pot, will be staged in Madrid for two years before possibly moving to the California resort of Indian Wells owned by another Kosmos stakeholder Larry Ellison"

The former world No.4 has won a US Open and made three semis and a final at the French Open but never gone beyond the fourth round in her home grand slam.Success at the Brisbane International has also escaped her but, at 35, the Gold Coast talent has another opportunity to make some happy memories on Brisbane’s Pat Rafter Arena.

Stosur was picked ahead of Daria Gavrilova and Priscilla Hon and will play world No.10 Aryna Sabalenka in Australia’s opening rubber against Belarus on Saturday.Australian spearhead and world No.9 Ashleigh Barty has drawn doubles partner and two-time Australian Open winner Victoria Azarenka in a tasty first day of action.

The Queensland duo are also set to play doubles together for the first time in what could be a deciding fifth rubber on Sunday.

If Australia wins they will host the final in November against Romania or France and chase their first Fed Cup title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley starred in 1974.

The Belarusian camp admitted their surprise when Stosur’s name was called at Friday’s draw announcement but Australian captain Alicia Molik said it made sense.

‘‘It’s a player Sam’s really familiar with and that’s really important in tie like this, one where no doubt experience has to count as well,’’ Molik said.

‘‘It’d be incredible if I saw her on the weekend get the best out of herself.

‘‘She’s achieved so much and more than most in her career and you talk about longevity and professionalism - you’ve got your No.1 person sitting right here.

‘‘[It’d be great] if Sam can enjoy some of those spoils and gets return for those efforts.’’

Stosur admitted home summers had rarely been kind to her in a 20-year career but that she couldn’t be thinking like that this weekend.

‘‘It’d be fantastic to win tomorrow, first for my team and second for myself,’’ said Stosur, who has won more Fed Cup singles matches (29) than any other Australian.

‘‘It’s always been a bit of a challenge playing in Pat Rafter Arena, but there’s some very good players I’ve played against too.

‘‘I’m not looking in the past of what has or hasn’t happened; it’s all about what I am going to be able to do tomorrow.’’"

But that doesn’t mean there won’t be plenty of tennis for all you tennis purists out there.

Watching Fognini on a clay court is sometimes a thing of beauty. He’s produced some of his best wins on the red dirt most notably beating Andy Murray in the Davis Cup on a clay court in Naples. But if he’s not in the mood then literally anything can happen! Rublev is also well known for having a fiery temperament which is why we’ve picked this out as a match to watch.

Last match: Fognini beat Rublev, 6-4, 6-3 on an outdoor hard court

Last match on clay: Rublev beat Fognini, 6-7, 6-2, 7-6

The University of Alberta Pandas tennis team couldn't overcome an early deficit to the Montreal Carabins, eventually dropping the Canadian University Tennis Final 4-3.

The loss snaps the Pandas extended winning streak, which began with a win in the bronze medal match at the 2016 national championship. During their streak, the Pandas captured back-to-back Western Canadian titles, and the 2017 Canadian University title. 

BOXSCORE

The Pandas fell behind early in a rematch of the 2017 final, as Montreal raced out to a 3-0 lead with wins in the doubles section and the first two singles matches. The Pandas were able to close the gap to 3-2 with wins by both Kristina Sanjevic (4-6, 6-1, 6-4) and Maki Oba (6-1, 6-1). However, Montreal earned a No. 6 singles win, as Sophie Dagenais knocked off Riyo Tomita 6-4, 7-5 to clinch the title for Montreal. 

Fourth-year Panda RJ Gan earned the Pandas third point, claiming the No. 2 singles match with a 6-2, 7-5 win.

Following semi-final victories over Toronto and Western respectively, the Pandas fell behind York early and could not overcome the Lions, losing 6-1, while the Bears and Rouge Et Or were close throughout match, but the RSEQ school scored successive victories over Alberta in singles play, paving the way for the gold medal win.

The Pandas trailed York 1-0 after doubles play, but then fell behind 2-1 following the first two singles play. The Lions continued to rack up the singles play victories, ending the match at 6-1 and claiming the gold medal.

On the men’s side, the Golden Bears drew first blood against Laval by claiming a ‘W’ in doubles play to go up 1-0 early. The Rouge Et Or then jumped ahead 3-1 thanks to consecutive singles wins. Alberta then needed three straight wins in singles play to capture the title, but dropped their first match to cede the victory.

Although Laval won the championship banner, the Bears and Rouge Et Or played out their final two matches, while the Golden Bears won, making the final score 4-3 for the RSEQ program.

This year’s championship, hosted at The Aviva Centre in Toronto and held in conjunction with the 2015 Women’s Rogers Cup, was the first year of a format that awarded men’s and women’s titles. The previous six championships, alternately hosted by Montreal and Toronto and always alongside the Rogers Cup, handed out just one overall school championship with men’s and women’s doubles and singles play rolled up into one score per competing program. In that format the U of A won a bronze, three straight silver medals from 2011 and 2013 and then the gold medal in 2014."
https://www.nzherald.co.nz/tennis/news/article.cfm?c_id=94&objectid=12223128,"Michael Venus has opened up on the ankle injury that threatens his participation at next month's French tennis Open.

The 2017 Roland Garros doubles champion is in a moon boot at his London home after rupturing ligaments in his left foot during his first round match at the ATP tournament in Marrakech last week.

""It was a good opportunity to go to Marrakech and get a couple of matches on the clay before Monte Carlo. But unfortunately, in the first match I went to slide for the ball and there was no clay on that patch and my foot got stuck and over I went on it,"" Venus said.

He returned home to London immediately for treatment and had booked a flight to this week's Monte Carlo Masters when the doctor gave him the bad news.""I had booked my flight to leave Friday morning from London but the doctor called me on Thursday afternoon to give me the news to say I needed a moon boot. So my first call was to Raven (Klaasen) and he had just boarded his flight from South Africa to fly to Monte Carlo. It wasn't easy for him but he managed to find a partner for the Masters.""

The doctors are loathed to put a time frame for his recovery, but typically an ankle ligament injury takes anywhere from 4-8 weeks to come right. The French Open starts in less than six weeks.

""I have completely torn my ligaments and they are not giving me too much as they know potentially I might try to push the boundary a little bit. But I am kind of going through the treatment and they said let's keep assessing it and we will see how it progresses,"" Venus said.

Venus knows he could miss the entire clay court swing but retains hope he could be ready for Paris where he achieved his greatest success with American Ryan Harrison in 2017, becoming a grand slam champion for the first time.

""I will just follow the advice of the doctors. I would love to be playing there but time will tell,"" Venus said. ""They say if I do try and push things and make things worth I could end up with surgery and six months off. So it's about sensible and listening to my body at the same time.""

The Kiwi number one has ranking points to defend having made the quarter-finals at this week's Monte Carlo Masters and next month's Madrid Masters with Klaasen last year. However the world number 14 is keeping positive."
https://www.britwatchsports.com/tennis-atp-monte-carlo-norrie-downs-mannarino-reach-monte-carlo-masters-second-round/,"Cameron Norrie def. Adrian Mannarino 6-4 6-3
Despite the occasional flashes of flair we see with France’s Adrian Mannarino, it was a far more solid performance from the British No. 2 Cameron Norrie than we have seen of late. Coming off what looked like an injury niggle in Houston, it looked to be a far more decisive Norrie putting pressure on the Frenchman.

In both sets first blood went to the Brit with breaks before the initial changeover at the start of both sets, and while Mannarino stuck with him, it was a more confident spell of play from Norrie on a surface he came back to last year, for the first time since playing in clay on the Futures tour in 2013.

He might not have the natural ability to slide and grind as some too, and at times his loopy forehand pulled the trigger a little too wildly, but in the first set he coaxed a stream of errors from the Frenchman, and did not face one break point on his own serve in the match."
http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/26525102/ex-champ-wawrinka-early-winner-monaco,"In opening first-round play Sunday at the Monte Carlo Masters, there were wins for three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland, ninth-seeded Borna Coric of Croatia, Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov and Argentine Guido Pella.

Wawrinka, the 2014 champion, advanced with a 7-5, 6-3 victory against Lucas Pouille -- who has lost all his matches since being crushed by Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open semis.

https://bnpparibasopen.com/news/winning-thiem-austrian-stuns-federer/,"No. 7 Seed Captures First ATP Masters 1000 Crown
For the second straight year, Roger Federer has come up just short of the title in Indian Wells.Federer, who converted just two of 11 break points in the two-hour-long match, was chasing a record sixth title in the desert. He’ll have to wait another year to try and break his deadlock with Novak Djokovic.

“For me, it’s unreal,” said Thiem, who with the win will match his career-high ranking of No. 4. “I enjoyed every second of it. I had to get used to Roger’s game. In the first set, he was playing amazing. I was struggling a little bit, but I fought my way back into the match.”

“Roger is one of the biggest legends of all time,” the Austrian added. “It’s amazing that we’re still able to compete against him in these big matches.”

Both players benefitted from pullouts en route to the final. Gael Monfils withdrew from his quarterfinal against Thiem due to injury, as did Rafael Nadal from his much-anticipated semifinal matchup with Federer, which would have been the 39th edition of the so-called ‘Fedal’ rivalry.

If his goal was to disrupt Thiem’s rhythm, mixing in dropshots and changing the pace, Federer accomplished that early on. Thiem faced a triple break point on his very first service game of the match. The 25-year-old managed to fight off all three, but couldn’t fend off a fourth.

Coming into the match, Thiem had been all but a lock from the service stripe. He’d been broken only twice in 46 service games, and didn’t lose serve during his semifinal win over Milos Raonic, where he faced only a single break point.

After an exchange of breaks, Federer would serve out the first set at the 36-minute mark.

However, Thiem turned things around, overpowering his opponent and grabbing the first break of the second set. With Federer serving at 1-2, 15-40, Thiem forced a forehand error to pull ahead.

Federer was just two points from victory with his opponent serving at 4-5, 30-all in the third. But to Thiem’s credit, he didn’t flinch. In the 11th game of the closer, Thiem chased down consecutive dropshots to set up his fourth and final break point, converting with a forehand pass. One game later, he fell to the court, a Masters 1000 champion at last.

Thiem, who recently added Chilean Nicolas Massu to his coaching staff, takes control of the career head-to-head at 3-2.

Typecast as a one-surface wonder, Thiem, who was raised on Viennese clay, has shown steady improvement on hard courts of late. While eight of his 12 career titles have come on clay, as Federer discovered in Stadium 1, he is more than capable on cement.

In 2018, the Swiss held three championship points against Juan Martin del Potro, only to leave empty-handed. This time around, the 37-year-old ran into a surging Dominic Thiem, who battled back from a set down to capture the first ATP Masters 1000 title of his career, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5."
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/20/johanna-konta-fed-cup-great-britain-kazakhstan-katie-boulter,"The last proper dust-up between Great Britain and Kazakhstan in this part of town was Anthony Joshua’s close win over Ivan Dychko in the super-heavyweight semi-finals at the 2012 London Olympics, and this Fed Cup tie looks headed for a similarly bruising conclusion on Sunday.

Johanna Konta put the home team on the board in the first match on day one, recovering from a slow start to beat the world No 107, Zarina Diyas, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in two hours and 38 minutes. The second singles was a mere seven minutes shorter but it seemed longer as the Kazakh terrier Yulia Putintseva saved three match points to beat Katie Boulter, 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (6).

The reverse singles on Sunday are equally hard to call, and Konta’s showdown at high noon with Putintseva – the world No 38, who shocked her in the first round of the French Open last year when 97 in the world – will set the tone for the drama’s closing act. Anne Keothavong’s tight-knit squad remain buoyant, however, knowing victory in this World Group II play-off would return Great Britain to the competition’s elite level for the first time in 26 years.


Fed Cup: Konta and Keothavong wary of Putintseva getting under their skin
The 5,000 fans who filled the arena could hardly have asked for more sustained entertainment on Saturday. After a minute’s applause in memory of the Davis Cup and British tennis stalwart Paul Hutchins, the spirit of the cup was stretched to perfectly acceptable limits as a witty Kazakh ensemble of two drums, a trumpet and trombone provided a raucous soundtrack to the hosts’ encouraging start.

There were some dubious interruptions, however, when over-enthusiastic travelling fans angered Konta with calls mid-shot as she butchered a volley on set point in the first frame, and again in the second set.

“You need to find your feet in these [noisy] surroundings,” said Konta, who trailed 5-1 in the first set before grinding her way back to parity and finishing with a convincing flourish. “It does shock you, but every Fed Cup it takes a bit of time to get used to. You get a bit more resilient as the match goes on. I didn’t get bogged down too much.”

As for the intermittent offerings of Kazakhstan’s answer to Kenny Ball – who broke into a decent rendition of It Ain’t Necessarily So when Diyas pulled off a couple of stunning winners – Konta said: “I was in two minds, because he was bloody good.”

Diyas said later: “I don’t think it was too much noise. It’s normal when you play in the Fed Cup. I didn’t think it affected her. There were British fans cheering also.” She expects a minor shoulder strain to recover in time for her match against Boulter: “I’ll be fine – nothing serious.”"
https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/sport/2019/04/tennis-andy-murray-takes-first-steps-back-after-hip-surgery.html,"Andy Murray has returned to a tennis court two months after undergoing hip resurfacing surgery.

Murray, who has not played competitively since his first round exit at the Australian Open in January, said last month he could possibly play at Wimbledon, as he was now pain-free after the surgery.

The 31-year-old posted a short video on Instagram, where he was seen hitting the ball in an outdoor court, while rallying with a wall, with a caption: ""It's a start.""

Murray had said he was not sure he could play in the singles draw at Wimbledon, a tournament he has won twice, but targeted a possible return in doubles at this year's tournament, as it put less stress on his hip.

The three-times Grand Slam champion compared his situation to that of American doubles player Bob Bryan, who returned to the court five-and-a-half months after a similar procedure.

Center was placed on leave Tuesday when federal officials unveiled indictments of a sweeping college admissions bribery scandal. Center was accused of taking up to nearly $100,000 to get a student into school by listing him as a tennis recruit and offering him a scholarship for books.

Once enrolled, the student never played tennis.

According to his indictment, one payment to Center was $60,000 in cash in an Austin hotel parking lot.

Center’s attorney has said the coach is innocent.

Center coached Texas for 18 years."

https://www.rotowire.com/tennis/article.php?id=44928,"The Miami Open ends up being one of the lesser-attended Premier Mandatory and Masters events on tour because players will often take the end of March off to prepare for the clay-court season. This still only slightly diminished the player pool and we were left with the deserving champions of Roger Federer and Ashleigh Barty. Here's what we learned during the back end of the Sunshine Double.

Cori Gauff goes by Coco

At just 15 years old, Coco was given a wild card into Miami and registered a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over fellow wild card Caty Mcnally in Round 1. The drawmakers certainly did Coco a favor by pitting her against the 17-year-old Mcnally, but winning any match in a Premier Mandatory event is worth celebrating and it will certainly be the first of many to come. She is still a few years away from being taken seriously at the WTA level, although it's a name worth remembering, so make sure you get it right."
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/04/19/tennis/rafael-nadal-novak-djokovic-monte-carlo-quarterfinals/#.XLuPputKhQI,"Defending champion Rafael Nadal and top-ranked Novak Djokovic eased into the Monte Carlo Masters quarterfinals on Thursday, remaining on course to meet in the final of the clay-court tournament they’ve long dominated.

The two rivals, who share 32 Grand Slam titles, could meet for a 54th time. They have won every tournament here since 2005 except for 2014. Nadal has won it a record 11 times overall, but Djokovic ended his 46-match winning streak in the 2013 edition and added another title two years later.

Nadal has won the last three editions, though, including last year’s without dropping a set.

After the 15-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic beat unseeded American Taylor Fritz 6-3, 6-0, the 17-time major winner Nadal handed Grigor Dimitrov yet another defeat, beating him 6-4, 6-1 in a repeat score of last year’s semifinal between the two.

Nadal improved to 12-1 overall against the unseeded Bulgarian, who made two big unforced errors on his forehand at 30-30 in the 10th game of the first set.

Serving for a place in the last eight, Nadal clinched victory on his second match point when Dimitrov patted a forehand into the net.

“I am happy the way that I am playing,” said Nadal, who beat Roberto Bautista Agut 6-1, 6-1 in the previous round. “The first two matches I played more than enough well to win. I had confident scores against two good players.”

The second-ranked Spaniard will next play Guido Pella, having won both previous matches against the unseeded Argentine.

Djokovic, who has won the past three Grand Slams, won on his first match point against the 21-year-old Fritz.

“Taylor plays really quick and has a big serve and just flattens the ball,” Djokovic said. “(He) doesn’t really have a clay court game, but he has done well this tournament. I just managed to break his resistance.”

Djokovic will next play 10th-seeded Daniil Medvedev of Russia.

Medvedev defeated sixth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece 6-2, 1-6, 6-4.

Djokovic won the three previous matches against the 23-year-old Medvedev, including a tough four-set encounter in the fourth round at this year’s Australian Open, but Friday’s match will be their first meeting on clay.

“He’s close to top 10 in the world. He’s definitely in the form of his life,” Djokovic remarked. “He’s had a good tournament so far here, winning quite comfortably in the first two matches and now against Tsitsipas.”

Pella beat No. 11 Marco Cecchinato of Italy 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.

Qualifier Lorenzo Sonego won 6-2, 7-5 against British player Cameron Norrie and the unseeded Italian will next face Dusan Lajovic.

The unseeded Serb upset No. 4 Dominic Thiem of Austria 6-3, 6-3, clinching victory on his third match point when French Open runner-up Thiem’s backhand went wide.

“It’s the best match of my life,” said the 48th-ranked Lajovic, who has never won a career title.

In another upset, No. 13 Fabio Fognini got the better of No. 3 Alexander Zverev 7-6 (8-6), 6-1, prompting raucous cheers from the large number of fans who crossed over the nearby border with Italy.

Fognini should have plenty of support when he plays No. 9 Borna Coric of Croatia, who beat unseeded Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-4, 6-2. Coric won on his fifth match point with a forehand winner down the right."

French Open champion Simona Halep had put Romania ahead with a commanding 6-3, 6-1 win against Kristina Mladenovic on indoor clay at the Kindarena in Rouen, northwest France.

Mladenovic, whose ranking position has plummeted from 10th to 66th in the space of two years, conceded 17 break-point chances on her serve. She also made 35 unforced errors, compared to 19 for the second-ranked Halep.

No. 21-ranked Garcia was also dominant, breaking Buzarnescu’s serve five times.

Following the reverse singles on Sunday, Garcia and Mladenovic will take on Irina-Camelia Begu and Monica Niculescu in the doubles.

France has won the Fed Cup twice while Romania, which beat defending champion Czech Republic in the last eight, has never reached the final.

They are meeting for only the second time, with Romania having won in 1976.

In the other semifinal, Australia and Belarus are 1-1 on hard courts at the Pat Rafter Arena in Brisbane.

The winners meet in the final on Nov. 9-10, with Australia playing at home if it advances."

In No. 1 singles action, sophomore Sahaja Yamalapalli defeated Giovanna Fioretti 6-0, 6-1, and junior Lusine Chobanyan took down Sofia San Jose Moreno 6-3, 6-4 in the No. 4 match.

Sophomore Karla De La Luz Montalvo and freshman Petra Kaszas teamed up to defeat San Jose Moreno and Dalia Ahmed in No. 3 doubles.

Yamalapalli (10-1 in SLC) now stands as only the second Bearkat to post 10 Southland Conference dual match wins in a year. Irina Sotnikova was 10-0 in 2009 and 10-1 in 2007.

Sahaja (23-8) and Chobanyan (24-11) join Sotnikova as the only Bearkats to post 20 or more singles wins (fall tournaments and dual matches) overall twice during their careers. Yamalapalli was 22-4 last year while Chobanyan was 25-4. Sotnikova went 27-1 as a senior in 2009 and 23-5 in 2006. 

Chobanyan (49-15) now ranks 12th in career singles wins and Yamalapalli (45-12) ranks 15th. The pair are the only two in the top 15 career standings who have only played two seasons.

The Bearkats 13-7 record this year and 14-6 record give the program its best record during two consecutive seasons, topping the previous best two-year mark of 24-13 (12-8 in 2006 and 12-5 in 2007).

Sam Houston State will compete at the Southland Conference Tournament April 26-28 in Corpus Christi."
https://www.bradenton.com/sports/article187162843.html,"Whitney Osuigwe sprang up at the net, holding her tennis racquet with two hands to deliver a backhanded overhead smash.

The sheer power caused two spectators, among the many that congregated to watch America’s future in women’s tennis, to gleefully chuckle from their chairs situated just past the bushes and fence separating them from IMG Academy’s featured clay court.

And power is something Osuigwe developed through years of playing against older female competition and male players.She’s definitely gotten a lot stronger,” doubles partner Caty McNally said. “She’s been more aggressive and she can just blow the opponent off the court.”

On Wednesday, Osuigwe won her second round singles match before winning a first round doubles match with McNally at the annual Eddie Herr International Junior Championships.

The tournament, held at IMG Academy, features four age divisions — 12s, 14s, 16s and 18s — for boys and girls.

Osuigwe, who is just 15 years old, is the No. 1 ranked player in the girls 18s.Winning an Eddie Herr title is on her checklist before devoting 2018 to playing the WTA Tour after a scorching 2017 that saw her capture the French Open girls title and the decision to turn pro.

“It’s my home tournament,” Osuigwe said about the Eddie Herr. “It’d be amazing (to win).”

A Bradenton native, Osuigwe wasn’t always solely focused on tennis. She played basketball and baseball and performed ballet.

But her best sport was tennis, and that was her focus starting at age 8 and 9.

Osuigwe’s game only grew on the IMG courts where her father, Desmond, has coached since 1997.

“When you are in this environment where all you see is tennis (players), you want to be one,” Desmond said.

Desmond, who played professionally on the ATP Tour, is one of several coaches that Whitney’s received guidance from over the years. However, Desmond is the one that’s worked on technique with her.

And it’s led to a huge 2017 season, where she’s won some International Tennis Federation (ITF) titles and her first Grand Slam title with the French Open girls singles crown.

“You’re not going to see too many 15 year olds accomplish what she’s accomplished,” Desmond said. “She knows it. She wants it. And she’s been hungry.”

To win a coveted Herr singles championship, Osuigwe must successfully navigate four more matches in the tournament, which concludes Sunday.

The event is open to the public with a $5 parking fee at Bayshore High School across the street from IMG Academy’s entrance on 34th Street West.

After this week, it’s a trek to South Florida for the Orange Bowl before shifting to the offseason and playing the WTA while balancing her high school studies.

“When we move to that level, we’re back to zero,” Desmond said. “So we have to start the year there.”

https://lastwordontennis.com/2019/04/13/atp-marrakech-final-prediction-benoit-paire-vs-pablo-andujar/,"The 2019 ATP Marrakech final pits Spain’s Pablo Andujar vs. charismatic Frenchman Benoit Paire on red clay at the ATP 250 level. Which player will merge victorious?

The head to head: Paire leads 3-1
The Frenchman has three wins back from 2012-13 (two of them on clay), but the most interesting thing is that they actually met two weeks ago, in the final of an ATP Challenger Tour event in Marbella. Andujar came back from 2-5 in the second set to finally take the title 4-6, 7-6(6), 6-4, saving a match point in the process.

Andujar’s history in Morocco . For some reason, the Moroccan soil has been a very kind place to the Spaniard. Three of Andujar’s four ATP level titles came at the Grand Prix Hassan II (2011, 2012 in Casablanca and last year already in Marrakech). Somehow he’s always able to bring his best tennis to this small North-African country. This year it’s not as surprising, as Andujar just captured two Challenger titles in a row (the aforementioned Marbella and then Alicante), which means he’s currently on a streak of 13 match wins in a row.

Paire’s inconsistencies

 
You don’t really have to look far in order to find proof of how weird of a player Benoit Paire is. Between those two great weeks for him – the one in Marbella and this one in Marrakech – he visited the Sophia Antiopolis Challenger where he was destroyed by a Challenger journeyman Roberto Marcora. Here in Marrakech, his biggest mental hiccups took place in the first round against Aljaz Bedene, but after barely scraping through, the Frenchman was pretty much flawless ever since (defeated Herbert, Munar and Tsonga)."

TITANS
Fullerton is now 11-4 this season and still in the race to be the top seed in the Big West Conference.
The Titans are 3-1 in conference play. They were able to dominate Hawai'I, Long Beach State and UC Davis but came short against CSUN.
Fullerton (3-1) sits second in the Big West Conference standings, right behind UC Santa Barbara (3-0) and in front of Long Beach State (4-2).
