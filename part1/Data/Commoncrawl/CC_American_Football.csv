Ms Ford was surprised to wake up the following morning to hundreds of angry messages on her Twitter account from Kansas City Chiefs fans.

Entering the final year of his rookie deal, former first-overall pick Jared Goff is in line for a mega-extension sometime in the next 23 months.

Despite the recent record-breaking deal handed out to division rival signal-caller Russell Wilson, the Los Angeles Rams quarterback said this week that he is not thinking about his contract situation as offseason workouts commence.

""Not on my mind at all,"" Goff told reporters, per the Los Angeles Times. ""I know the deal and understand that I hired an agent for that reason, and things always work out. You continue to play well, it will work itself out.""


Goff is among a quartet of young signal-callers who could earn big money over the next two seasons. Dak Prescott's contract expires after the 2019 season. So does Carson Wentz's, though Philly should exercise his fifth-year option. Patrick Mahomes is rumored to become the first $200 million quarterback when his deal is negotiated.

Los Angeles is expected to exercise Goff's fifth-year option before it offers any extension to the fourth-year quarterback. Under that option, Goff would make over $20 million guaranteed for injury in 2020, a steep raise from $4.3 million in 2019, per Spotrac. The deadline to place the option on Goff is May 3.

C'mon, it's opening night at Soldier Field. That's old-school. And we get a prime-time seat to watch Aaron Rodgers -- in his first game under new coach Matt LaFleur -- match up to the speed and playmaking talent of the Bears' defense.

Mike Clay, fantasy writer: Browns at Jets on Monday, Sept. 16 (Week 2). This matchup gave us Baker Mayfield's coming-out party in 2018, and perhaps the 2019 version will feature two playoff teams. That might seem optimistic for the Jets, but second-year QB Sam Darnold finished strong as a rookie, New York has one of the league's easiest schedules, and while the defense has holes, it includes some intriguing star power. If that isn't enough, the Baker-to-OBJ connection under the lights could be entertaining.

KC Joyner, fantasy writer: Steelers at Patriots on Sunday, Sept. 8 (Week 1). Pittsburgh's entire offseason has revolved around internal battles. Facing New England in the Week 1 Sunday night matchup will let the world know in a hurry if the Steelers were able to refocus their efforts on external battles."

Founded by Pro Football Hall of Fame executive Bill Polian and TV/film producer Charlie Ebersol, the AAF was hoping to become a developmental league.

The league is the latest to join a graveyard of NFL rivals, which seem to never get enough traction with fans or support from investors to take on a dominant incumbent that earns close to $15 billion a year in revenue. While the NFL has had troubled ratings in recent years — and somehow fallen into the cross-hairs of both Donald Trump, who has accused the league of going soft, and activists who see white, wealthy owners blacklisting players like Colin Kaepernick — it is hard to displace a national institution like a sports league."

The uniforms and logos are sleek, and the pace of play of the new league should be efficient, too.
The Alliance of American Football, a new professional football league, kicks off its inaugural season in 2019, with all eight teams debuting after months of assembling rosters filled with blast-from-the-past players and coaches. Purposefully scheduled during the NFL's offseason, the league hopes to attract football fans eager to turn their obsession into a year-round activity.
Sporting News has assembled all the information you need to follow the Alliance of American Football in its first season, including a full weekly TV schedule, team-by-team rosters and a guide to explain the main rules difference from the NFL."

Based on Wednesday's filings to a Texas court, the league has about $48.4 million in liabilities—including about $9.6 million owed to creditors—but only about $11.4 million in assets.

The league will file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which is the most common form in the United States, per Rothstein, giving it an opportunity to sell assets to pay creditors.

The AAF provided a statement after the latest filing:

Not all of them, though. 

A handful of quality performers, capable of starting, remain available. Granted, it's a small group with questions marks, but wise teams that decided to wait out the market will be able to revisit free agency and address problem areas that persist after the draft. 

Recently, an influx of talent from the now-defunct Alliance of American Football spurred free-agent interest as organizations added depth to their rosters.

A few recognizable names like Eric Berry and Marshawn Lynch remain available, but how much they can actually contribute at this point of their careers is in doubt.

Founded and led by television producer Charlie Ebersol, the Alliance of American Football is also backed in part by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, The Chernin Group, and venture capitalist Keith Rabois.

If it works, why did Dundon commit $250 million only to comment six weeks later that he might fold the league? Unless he is a secret plant from Vince McMahon and the XFL, I honestly have no idea.

“I am extremely disappointed to learn Tom Dundon has decided to suspend all football operations of the Alliance of American Football,” Polian said in a statement. “When Mr Dundon took over, it was the belief of my co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, and myself that we would finish the season, pay our creditors, and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all. The momentum generated by our players, coaches and football staff had us well positioned for future success. Regrettably, we will not have that opportunity.”

The league isn’t officially folding, the people said Tuesday, at least not yet. An official announcement about its status was expected soon. In a statement, Bill Polian, one of the league’s founders, confirmed the decision and expressed disappointment.

The Alliance is the latest in a long line of upstart professional football leagues that tried and failed to capitalize on the seemingly insatiable appetite for the sport in America. Because the N.F.L. draws an average of about 15 million viewers for each game over its five-month season, the start-up owners tend to assume that a new league with just a fraction of that audience will succeed."

“We are deeply disappointed to be taking this action,” the league said in the statement. “The AAF was created to be a dynamic, developmental professional football league powered by an unprecedented alliance between players, fans and the game. The AAF strove to create new opportunities for talented players, coaches, executives and officials.”

After the deal with Dundon, sources say it became clear to league co-founders Charlie Ebersol and Bill Polian that Dundon’s objectives were different from the original plan.

Ebersol and Polian’s plan was to develop the league for three years on its own before becoming a feeder system to the NFL. Dundon, however, wanted to create that minor league immediately and sought to use the leverage of folding the AAF to get a deal with the NFL Players Association to better insure a flow between leagues.

The 6-foot-2, 208-pound corner was actually set to play at Ohio State coming out of high-school until he was “medically disqualified” from playing football due to a string of knee injuries he suffered over his prep career. After transferring to Auburn, he was met with another setback. Early in fall camp, Dean suffered another knee injury that took his entire 2016 season away from him.

That American football is even popular with Americans can often be a mystery to foreigners. It's easy, for instance, for a diehard AFL fan to dismiss it as helmeted hoopla.

Take game time. In the typical Aussie rules game, lasting about 2.5 hours, there is about 80 minutes of play. The typical NFL game, by comparison, takes three hours but has less than 12 minutes of actual play."

This is what American football looks like south of the border, where the sport is beginning to thrive.

Barring a trade, the Buccaneers will be the fifth team on the clock and will have a new potential star on the roster less than an hour into the proceedings. The remaining six rounds will be conducted on Friday night and Saturday afternoon, and Tampa Bay currently owns one selection in each round.

In the final days leading up to the this year's draft, we are examining six positions in which the Buccaneers might reasonably be expected to have interest this year, three on offense and three on defense. We'll look at the available prospects, the Buccaneers' recent history of drafting at the position and the team's existing depth at that spot. At the end, Carmen Vitali and I will each suggest one good fit for the Buccaneers from this year's pool of prospects.

Here is the schedule of the positions we are analyzing in this six-part series:

Friday, April 19: Running Backs
Saturday, April 20: Linebackers
Sunday, April 21: Offensive Linemen
Monday, April 22: Defensive Linemen/Edge Rushers
Tuesday, April 23: Wide Receivers
Wednesday, April 24: Defensive Backs
Today's focus: Linebacker, which is already a position in flux for the Buccaneers thanks to one key departure, a new arrival in free agency and, just as critically, a new 3-4 defensive scheme. One important note: For this position we are considering players who would be labeled as ""inside linebackers"" in that 3-4 front. Pass-rushing linebackers, like Kentucky's Josh Allen, will be included in the defensive linemen/edge rushers group on Monday.

Ebersol, a TV and film producer, had nothing but praise for Dundon -- as would be expected after committing to $250 million in funding -- at the Feb. 19 media briefing at PNC Arena.

“If you were going to design the perfect person to invest in a startup football league, he’d be in his mid-40s, he’d be a self-made American businessman who had ground through the challenges of startup life and somebody who was passionate about football,” Ebersol said.

Ebersol said Dundon was that person, later referring to what he called the “glow of Tom Dundon.”

“When Tom puts his focus into something and building something, he’s not building to build but building to win,” Ebersol said.But on Tuesday, six weeks later, the AAF notified its employees it was suspending operations, according to emails provided to multiple media outlets. It was reported that Dundon, unable to work out an agreement with the NFL Players Association, made the decision. The league said it will keep a skeleton staff and look for other investors.

Polian released a statement Tuesday saying he was “extremely disappointed” by Dundon’s decision and had hoped to “make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all.”

Dundon had hoped to use an influx of players from NFL practice squads, allowing them to further develop in the AAF, as well as a system to send players from the AAF to the NFL. Unable to get NFLPA approval, he threatened to shut down the eight-team league.

Dundon could not immediately be reached Tuesday."

The business reception at the Shooting Star Casino in Mahnomen was part of the fourth Town Takeover, an annual recognition by the Vikings and Innovative Office Solutions for a community’s support of high school football (the recap of that event will be posted this week).

The joy — and jerseys spotted throughout the weekend — show that there’s plenty of concurrent support for the Class A State Champion Mahnomen-Waubun Thunderbirds and the Vikings in the communities whose combined population is in the 1,600s, particularly for Purple No. 19.

Once bitter rivals, Mahnomen-Waubun came together to co-op their football team for the first time last fall. The proud programs united, went 13-0 and won a state title with a thrilling 22-21 win over BOLD at U.S. Bank Stadium in November.

After the business reception — and just west of Waubun’s snow-covered high school field — a booster event packed Bear Sports Bar and featured a replay of the title game, appearances by Stephen Weatherly, Rashod Hill, Pete Bercich and Vikings cheerleaders and dozens more Thielen jerseys.


Mahnomen-Waubun Head Coach John Clark said Thielen’s story is “right out of the movies. You don’t believe it.”

But seeing is believing, and everyone knows Thielen’s progression from a modest scholarship offer at Minnesota State, Mankato, to being asked to stay with the Vikings following a tryout as a rookie in 2013 to grinding through a special teams role to becoming a starter, Pro Bowler, All-Pro and household name beyond the Land of 10,000 Lakes."

It has now ceased all business operations.

A group of limited companies tied to the league have listed assets of $11.3m (€10m) and liabilities of $48.3m. The eight-team spring-season American football league, which collapsed just eight weeks into its inaugural campaign, also has just over $500,000 in cash.

All remaining assets will be sold to pay back creditors. MGM Resorts International, Aramark Sports and Silicon Valley Bank have claims secured by the property. Parties with unsecured claims, as reported by Front Office Sports, include broadcast partner CBS, as well as multiple venues, hotels and private businesses.

The Alliance is also facing multiple lawsuits from former employees, with potentially more to come. The filing for bankruptcy, however, means it will take longer for players, coaches, staff and other creditors to be paid amounts owed.

“We are deeply disappointed to be taking this action,” the league said in a statement. “The AAF is committed to ensuring that our bankruptcy proceeds in an efficient and orderly manner. Pursuant to the bankruptcy laws, a trustee will be empowered to resolve all matters related to the AAF’s remaining assets and liabilities, including ongoing matters related to player contracts.”

XFL commissioner Oliver Luck this week told SportBusiness that the demise of the Alliance served as a “cautionary tale” for Vince McMahon’s spring-season league, which is due to start in 2020.

“There’s a lot that we’ve learned [from the Alliance] and we’re trying to make sure that we make sure we use it as a cautionary tale, quite honestly,” Luck said. “We’ve tried to be as clear-eyed and as sober as we could and analyse what went well – because some things went well – and what didn’t go well.”"

Games will not be played this weekend, and the Alliance has informed multiple team employees — including, but not limited to, players — that their tenure in the league is over. AAF co-founder Charlie Ebersol sent an email to various staff members, which was obtained by KSL.com and multiple other media outlets, championing the leagues successes that include an average television audience of 556,000 people across broadcasts on CBS, CBS Sports Network, the NFL Network and TNT, according to the Sports Business Journal.

But the decision has been made to suspend operations, and only a fraction of league employees will remain as the league attempts to ""seek new investment capital and restructure our business.""

""Should those efforts prove successful, we look forward to working with many of you on season two,"" the email read. ""As a follow-up to this communication, we will reach out to the personnel who will be involved in that continuation effort.

With the draft approaching, Mason and Saccomano take a look back at the Broncos' draft history -- focusing on the years up to 1983. They start by chronicling the early AFL drafts -- when some players were drafted as PR exercises -- before moving on to a look back at the details around the drafting of RB Floyd Little in 1972, the series of strong drafts in the John Ralston era from 1972-76, and, finally, the post-draft trade for John Elway 36 years ago, with an inside look at how it came together from the Broncos' end."

But I don’t feel bad for Mike Singletary, or Manziel, or even Brandon Silvers, the underdog quarterback who Singletary kept calling “Brian” and kept starting instead of Johnny Football for reasons that have yet to be reasonably explained.

I don’t even feel bad for the city of Memphis because the city didn’t really need this latest version of professional football, and never really embraced it anyways. We’ve got the Grizzlies, and the Tigers, and the Redbirds, and have you seen the crowds for this new soccer team?

Memphis was just fine without the AAF, and at least now the University of Memphis football team can play its spring game with a field featuring its logo.But I do feel bad for Victor and Rebecca Ho, the AAF’s first two season-ticket holders who also happened to be the first two Memphis Express season-ticket holders, who just liked the idea of supporting a sports team at the ground floor.

I feel bad for Daniel and Michelle Abendroth, who started the Express-and-Goal podcast because they just liked the idea that you’re “able to afford to go to a football game in your home city,” Daniel said in the Liberty Bowl parking lot Saturday before what will likely now go down as the final Express game ever."
https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-draft-panel-who-is-your-guy-in-the-2019-class,"I’m going to give you a few. Ryan Finley, a quarterback out of North Carolina State. I feel like more people are liking him now than they did before. Jalin Moore – the running back out of Appalachian State. I’m a big fan. Cornerback Corey Ballentine out of Washburn. I love that kid, he’s one of my favorites. Jace Sternberger, the tight end out of Texas A&M, he’s one of my favorites. I’m a big Dalton Risner fan (OT, Kansas State). I’ve had him in the first round of both of my mock drafts. Florida safety Chauncey Gardner-Johnson. He’s one of my favorites. As is TCU defensive lineman L.J. Collier.

Matt Bowen, ESPN

I’m going with Alabama running back Damien Harris. Yes, Harris doesn’t have the same explosive skill set as college teammate Josh Jacobs – whom I see as the No. 1 running back in this class – and I get that. However, Harris has the classic, Alabama traits at the running back position, along with the make-up to develop quickly into a three-down back at the pro level. He is a decisive, downhill runner with the footwork to pick through the wash and enough speed – 4.57 – to hit the edge. Plus, he competes in pass pro and displays the soft hands to catch the ball out of the backfield in a pro-ready frame at 5-foot-10, 216 pounds. Tough, dependable player who checks the boxes as a solid Day 2 pick.

Daniel Jeremiah, NFL Network

Let’s start with Alabama running back Josh Jacobs. I know a lot of people punted on him because he didn’t run as fast and didn’t have a ton of production, but I believe in the kid. I think he can do everything. One other guy I’m a little bit higher on is L.J. Collier from TCU. I think he’s a really dynamic and explosive defensive lineman, and I like him."
https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/big-move-brewing-questions-about-the-draft-falcons-trading-up-julio-jones-more,"Charles from Atlanta, GA
Hi Beek! Things are getting exciting as we move closer to the draft dates! I like what the brain trusts at the Falcons are doing, building depth and opportunities for certain players to showcase their talents, like Chris Odom. But in my humble opinion, their needs are still the same: OL, edge rushers, DL and corners. And I would expect the draft choices to address those needs. However! Sometimes a player becomes available that tempts conventional wisdom (can you say 'Ridley' in 2018?). Do you see such a player that could be available this year at pick 14?

Matt: Hey, Charles. Well, what positions would fall under that category at this point? I think if the Falcons took a quarterback, receiver, tight end, running back or a specialist (kicker/punter) with the 14th overall pick, that would surprise us all. Heck, you could throw center in there as well even though there’s a good one in this class – Garrett Bradbury of NC State – and Alex Mack is entering his 11th season in the league. To answer to your question, no, I do not see the Falcons taking any player from the positions I just rattled off. And if the Falcons took another receiver … I think Atlanta fans would be stunned. The only potential surprise twist (and it wouldn’t be a totally shocking move, to be honest) would be taking a cornerback, Charles. There are two very good linebackers in this draft class, too – Devin White and Devon Bush – but I don’t see that happening, either. I’d count on the Falcons taking a right tackle, defensive tackle or an edge rusher. But, hey, you never know until the pick is in."
https://www.redskins.com/news/prospect-profiles-in-choosing-football-over-baseball-kyler-murray-established-hi,"Kyler Murray was supposed to play professional baseball. After serving as the Oklahoma quarterback this past fall, the Sooners' center fielder would report to spring training with the Oakland Athletics, who drafted him with the No. 9 pick in the 2018 MLB Draft and who he signed with about two weeks after the selection.

But then Murray took the college football world by storm. He threw for more than 4,000 yards and 40 touchdowns and added 1,000 yards and 12 scores on the ground, carrying Oklahoma to its third College Football Playoff appearance in four years. In his only season as a starter, Murray won the Heisman Trophy and morphed into an elite NFL prospect.

Murray's historic season complicated his future plans, but he ultimately decided to pursue a career as a thrower rather than a retriever, setting him up to potentially become the No. 1 pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.

“I didn’t really know how the NFL felt about me because I hadn’t played in two and a half years or so,” Murray said while speaking to reporters at the NFL Combine. “After having the season I had, going into that season with the mindset of doing my thing, lay it all out there and we’ll see what happens at the end of the day. That’s what I did. The NFL kind of heated up and here we are.”



Coming out of high school, Murray was one of the highest-rated quarterbacks in the country. After a season where he split time as the starter for Texas A&M, Murray transferred to Oklahoma, where he was forced to sit out a season before backing up Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield in 2017. Murray's time finally came last season and he flourished. He completed 69 percent of his passes for 4,361 yards and 42 touchdowns. He also showcased his mobility, running for 1,001 yards.

According to Kyle Crabbs of the Draft Network, “Murray is a fascinating NFL Draft prospect. His size presents limitations to consistently see intermediate breaks in the [middle of the field] and will pose an injury concern in the NFL. Murray has speed, escapability, a powerful throwing arm and enough general accuracy to allow gifted catch point receivers to adjust and ensure the catch. Murray is not a ""one-size-fits-all"" prospect, but in an offense utilizing RPO/spread concepts, he can be an explosive weapon and an effective starting QB.”"

But according to a report from CBS Sports’ Pete Prisco (h/t NBC Sports Bay Area), the top-drafting Cardinals may be opting to go another direction.

 Initially, the ownership pushed for Kyler Murray. That much I know, I was told that. The reason they did is they are having a hard time selling tickets. Well, they put it out there.

https://www.profootballhof.com/football-history/birth-of-pro-football/,"The sport of American football itself was relatively new in 1892. Its roots stemmed from two sports, soccer and rugby, which had enjoyed long-time popularity in many nations of the world. On November 6, 1869, Rutgers and Princeton played what was billed as the first college football game. However, it wasn't until the 1880s that a great rugby player from Yale, Walter Camp, pioneered rules changes that slowly transformed rugby into the new game of American Football.

Meanwhile, athletic clubs that sponsored a great variety of sports teams became a popular phenomenon in the United States in the years immediately after the Civil War. One of the sports the athletic club embraced was football.

By the 1880s, most athletic clubs had a football team. Competition was heated and each club vowed to stock its teams with the best players available. Toward this end, some clubs obtained jobs for star players. Others ""awarded"" expensive trophies or watches to their players, who would in turn pawn their awards, only to receive them again and again after each game they played. A popular practice was to offer double expense money to players for their services. Since football players were supposed to be amateurs, these practices were questioned by the Amateur Athletic Union but for every tactic declared illegal, a new one was developed.

Thus the scene was set for the AAA-PAC showdown. The actions before, during and after the game are as intriguing as the fact that someone was openly paid to play football for the first time. The Allegheny football team, founded in 1890, and the Pittsburgh team, founded a year later, already were heated rivals when they met in the first of two games in the 1892 season and wound up in a 6-6 tie. Adding fuel to the fire was the AAA claim that the PAC's top player and coach, William Kirschner, was a professional because, as a paid instructor for the PAC, his salary went up and his work load down during the football season. With controversy raging, both sides began to explore methods of beefing up their squads.

https://www.chicagobears.com/news/bears-featured-in-two-of-nfl-s-top-10-games,"According to NFL.com analyst Elliot Harrison, the Bears will play in two of the NFL’s top 10 games during the 2019 season, both on Sunday Night Football.

Harrison ranks the Bears-Chiefs clash Dec. 22 at Soldier Field as the eighth best game in 2019 and the Bears-Rams contest Nov. 17 in Los Angeles 10th on his list.

The game against the Chiefs will pit two quarterbacks selected high in the 2017 draft against each other in the Bears’ Mitchell Trubisky and Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes. It will also feature Bears coach Matt Nagy facing his mentor, Chiefs coach Andy Reid. Before joining the Bears last year, Nagy spent 10 seasons as an assistant under Reid with the Eagles and Chiefs.

Capsules of Bears’ 2019 opponents
“Matt Nagy owns unique insight into Patrick Mahomes’ career, considering he was the reigning MVP's first offensive coordinator in the league and probably had much to do with Andy Reid feeling like he could move forward with the young quarterback,” Harrison wrote. “Nagy's last year in Kansas City was not only Mahomes' first, but also Alex Smith's last -- you know, when Smith led the NFL in passer rating.

“Now Nagy is trying to do the same quality work with Mitch Trubisky, but his new team's strength is actually its top-flight defense. That Bears' unit will be charged with stopping Mahomes and the most explosive offense going right now.”

The game against the high-powered Rams will be a rematch of the Bears’ 15-6 win last Dec. 9 at Soldier Field. In that contest, the Chicago defense did not allow a touchdown while generating four interceptions and a safety. The unit held running back Todd Gurley to a season-low 28 yards on 11 carries and quarterback Jared Goff to a career-low 19.1 passer rating.


Harrison calls the battle “a clash of divergent styles,” writing, “The Bears have proven they can shut down high-octane offenses, like when they held these Rams to six points last season. Then again, that was in the frigid night air of Soldier Field last December. How will it go between two obvious contenders out in the warm environs of L.A.? Will epic defense win the day again?”

The best game of the season on Harrison’s list is Saints at Rams in Week 2, followed by Chiefs at Patriots in Week 14. The two contests are rematches of last year’s NFC and AFC Championship Games, respectively."
http://dblcoverage.com/bafa-nl-19-meet-the-darlington-steam/,"The other new addition to the league this season are the Darlington Steam, who come into their first season with a fair head of… well, steam! 

They’ve got a roster of around 60 on the books and have had a very active preseason building up to their inaugural league campaign – testing themselves against some well-established outfits as they get ready to kick off their life in the league with a trip to the 1-0 Clyde Valley Blackhawks on Sunday!

The newest team to emerge in a North East region with a growing pedigree for American Football development, the Steam come into their first National League season looking hungry… and looking good – they’ve got one of the smarter first-year kits I’ve seen, and have impressed with their home facilities as they built up to league membership, sharing a facility with both Darlington Rugby and Football clubs at Blackwell Meadows.

Considering they’re yet to take a single league snap, the Steam were getting quite a lot of favourable glances in the UK American Football Scene preseason polls – could Darlington emerge as a dark horse this season?

We spoke with Steam Head Coach Darren Mitchell to learn more:

 

 

DC: Hi guys, first things first – welcome to the league and congratulations on your successful completion of the BAFA Associate process!

As the popularity of American Football begins to climb in the UK once again, there’s no small number of teams beginning to pop up – however, with BAFA’s new, much tougher, associate process, far fewer teams have made the cut in recent seasons than we’d come to expect.

What do you think have been the key to your programme succeeding while other teams, who’ve perhaps been seeking associate status for longer, continue to struggle?

DS: The biggest way BAFA have raised the bar for teams is increasing required roster sizes – as the Associate process went on we were required to increase our player numbers each time and it was a great motivation for us. We weren’t going to fail, we put everything in place in order to succeed – and of course it makes absolute sense to have high standards when it comes to player numbers – without players, we don’t have a team!

Our partnership with Blackwell Meadows, our home venue, has also really helped us out – everyone is very impressed with the facilities, the staff there make sure everyone gets looked after.

Image may contain: one or more people, people playing sport, grass, outdoor and nature

DC: What does it mean to the team to have successfully achieved league status?

DS: On a personal level, one of the biggest moments of my life. This was an endgame for me and one I never thought possible but we have a great team here who all work together and it has made a dream possible.

Since we gained entry, we have had a huge boost in recruitment, though in fairness I was expecting that if I’m honest. We are in an ideal situation because otherwise the nearest league club to us is Gateshead. As such, all the experienced players who live in Teesside, Newton Aycliffe, Durham, Stockton, etc? We’re the closest team for most of them.

Sure, those players who were already with clubs weren’t eager to leave an established league side for one that was still only an Associate side, but now we are a national league team we’ve seen a number of experienced players come on board ready for 2019!

We’re also attracting something of a fan base – we had nearly 200 at our first Associate game vs Lincolnshire Bombers, and now we’re actually playing in the league the hopes are we’ll continue to up those numbers from here."
https://readamericanfootball.com/2019/04/20/half-a-decade-later-the-2014-draft-class-has-defined-the-nfl/,"James White took the toss from Tom Brady with a lane in front of him. He took the space, and scored the only overtime touchdown in Super Bowl history a few seconds later.

It completed the greatest comeback in NFL history, and gave the New England Patriots their fifth Super Bowl title with a 34-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons. The other side of the coin was Jake Matthews, Atlanta’s left tackle who committed two crucial holding penalties in the second half as his team’s 25-point lead wilted away.

The man who scored the opening touchdown of that game was Devonta Freeman, who put the Falcons up 7-0 in the second quarter. His missed chip block also allowed Dont’a Hightower to force a fumble on Matt Ryan with the Patriots down 28-12 in the fourth quarter, opening the door for the New England comeback.

But other than playing key roles on opposite sides of arguably the greatest game in NFL history, White, Matthews, and Freeman have something else in common. All three of them were selected in the 2014 NFL Draft.

Jamie Squire/Getty Images SportJamie Squire/Getty Images Sport

The 2014 NFL Draft class has defined the recent NFL. From a player like Matthews who was selected in the top ten all the way down to undrafted talent, the rookies who entered the league five years ago have contributed more to this league than any class in recent memory.

Almost all of the most iconic moments in the league over the last five years have had a member of the 2014 draft class squarely in the middle of the action. Super Bowls, playoff games, ground-breakers, and even fights between teammates were all set into motion across the days of the 2014 NFL Draft.

It was one of the most unique draft classes in NFL history, and its fingerprints have been all over the league for the last half-decade.

White’s game-winning touchdown in Super Bowl LI was the first of three consecutive trips to the big game for the Patriots. The only reason they didn’t come out of it with a three-peat was the Philadelphia Eagles, who beat New England 41-33 in another legendary Super Bowl one year later.

The Philly Special has almost taken on a life of its own in the 14 months since it happened. It was one of the most high-risk, high-reward play calls in NFL history, and the reward was Nick Foles becoming the first quarterback in Super Bowl history to throw and catch a touchdown pass. It was the key point in the first Lombardi Trophy in Eagles history, and a life-changing night for generations of Philadelphians. The man who threw the touchdown pass to Foles was Trey Burton, an undrafted tight end from the 2014 class."
https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/fantasy-football-the-fantasy-outlook-for-the-aaf-players-who-have-gotten-nfl-deals,"Though a surprisingly high number of quarterbacks signed with NFL teams, only Wolford and Gilbert are on my radar. And even so, both have an uphill battle to even be their respective team’s primary backups – Wolford would need to beat out Blake Bortles and Gilbert would need to beat out Drew Stanton.

Gilbert led all AAF quarterbacks in passing yards (2,152), yards per attempt (8.3), touchdown-to-interception ratio (4.3), PFF grade (79.6), and passer rating (99.1). Wolford ranked second in passing yards (1,616), yards per attempt (7.8), touchdown-to-interception ratio (2.0), PFF grade (79.3), and passer rating (95.9). The next-closest quarterback in each category was a sizeable distance behind both passers.

Gilbert was a sixth-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, playing briefly with the Rams, Patriots, Lions, Raiders, and Panthers. He’s thrown just three passes at the NFL level. Wolford went undrafted in 2018 but enjoyed a brief stint with the Jets before getting cut in early September. In his final season at Wake Forest he was our fourth-highest-graded passer, behind only Baker Mayfield, Will Grier, and Justin Herbert.

RUNNING BACKS
Kenneth Farrow signed with the Dolphins
Farrow went undrafted in 2016 but still played 13 games with the Chargers, garnering 73 touches. He enjoyed a brief stint with the Patriots last season but failed to appear in any game. In the AAF, Farrow ranked third among all running backs in snaps (274), third in rushing yards (372), and ninth in receiving yards (95). Unfortunately, he didn’t rank highly in our grades or in any of our efficiency metrics. For that reason, he’s not really on my radar. If you want to argue for him as a deep sleeper, it would be because he is on a Dolphins depth chart that currently only includes Kenyan Drake and Kalen Ballage in addition to him, but that’s the only real point in his favor.

WIDE RECEIVERS
Charles Johnson signed with the Eagles
Rashad Ross signed with the Panthers
Reece Horn signed with the Dolphins
Demornay Pierson-El signed with the Raiders
Greg Ward signed with the Eagles


Of the names listed in this article, Johnson and Ross probably have the best chances of proving to be fantasy producers at some point this year. Both were also our highest-graded and most productive receivers, and both have already found some success at the NFL level.

Johnson led all wide receivers in receptions (68), receiving yards (687), PFF grade (85.5), first downs (36), and ranked second in receiving touchdowns (five). Ross ranked second in receiving yards (583), PFF grade (83.2), first downs (28), and first in receiving touchdowns (seven). Ross ranked first and Johnson second in yardage market share (34% to 32%). Ross also ranked slightly better in yards per target average (11.0 to 10.1). Among all wide receivers to see at least 20 targets, Ross also ranked first (136.2) and Johnson ranked second (123.8) in WR rating. No other wide receiver came close in any category.

Horn was our third-highest-graded wide receiver, Pierson-El fourth, and Ward 19th. Horn (429) and Pierson-El (427) both ranked top-five in receiving yards, and both are considerably younger than Johnson and Ross. Horn is 26 and Pierson-El is 23. Horn put up big numbers in college (albeit at a Division II school), while Pierson-El was far less productive at Nebraska. Ward was easily the least-productive of the group, catching just 22 of 40 targets for 214 yards and zero touchdowns."

The San Diego Fleet cancelled practiced about a half hour before it was scheduled to start.

The AAF seemed to have a better chance of surviving than other alternative leagues, such as the USFL and the World League, because of the people and philosophies involved.

Polian and co-founder Charlie Ebersol, a television and film producer, envisioned it as a development league for the NFL with several rules tweaks designed to speed up play and make it safer. There were no kickoffs or PATs. Teams had to go for a two-point conversion after touchdowns.

Johnny Manziel signs with new Alliance league, will join Memphis
Manziel, who had joined the Canadian Football League last season in an effort to resurrect his career, recently joined the Memphis franchise after having his contract with the Montreal Alouettes terminated.

Among the league's coaches were Steve Spurrier, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz and Mike Riley. The league included teams in Orlando, Atlanta, San Diego, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, Birmingham and Memphis.

While it clearly wasn't NFL-caliber football, it was entertaining and helped fill the post-Super Bowl void.

However, there were signs of trouble in a league put together in less than one year.

Dundon invested $250 million in the AAF shortly after play began. At the time, Ebersol said reports the Alliance was short on cash and needed a bailout from Dundon in order to make payroll were untrue. He said the league had a technical glitch in its payroll system that was fixed.

The AAF aspired to be a league for players with NFL hopes, but it could not reach agreement with the NFLPA to use players at the end of NFL rosters."
https://deadspin.com/lawsuit-claims-the-aaf-intentionally-misled-and-defraud-1833959393,"In an unsurprising turn of events, two players who played for a league that was suddenly dissolved for comically greedy purposes are now suing that league for screwing them out of a job.

In a class-action complaint brought to the Superior Court of California, Birmingham Iron punter Colton Schmidt and Orlando Apollos linebacker Reggie Northrup allege they were misled about the AAF’s financial viability and were deceived in regards to majority owner Tom Dundon’s plan to get rid of the league once he got his hands on the league’s gambling and technology intellectual property. The players’ lawyers argue Schmidt and Northrup would not have subjected themselves to “serious risk of physical or damage to [their] health” or “foregone other financial opportunities” had they been aware of these things.According to the complaint, the two players—acting individually and on behalf of “all players who contracted with” the AAF—are seeking damages for: breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, violating labor codes, violating business and professions codes, fraud, false promise and inducing breach of contract.

The players’ lawyers are essentially arguing a few major things. First, that players who signed with the AAF had more than enough reason to believe the league would last much longer than it did. The suit cites examples of CEO Charlie Ebersol talking about the Alliance’s long term goals.The plaintiffs also argue that the league choosing not to pay its players is an indication that the AAF entered the contracts in bad faith. Even though AAF contracts were not guaranteed, there was an implication that if a player chose to sign a three-year deal, they would at least have the opportunity to get to year three without fear of the league up and dying—a side of the bargain that the AAF did not hold up.

The final main argument is that all of the shittiness that AAF players had to deal with after it had dissolved (i.e. having to pay for their own flights back home from suddenly-cancelled road games) were a result of the AAF, Dundon and Ebersol intentionally defrauding players about the league’s long-term viability, and hiding the fact that the AAF was insolvent, by not breaking the news to players until it was too late."
https://www.ocregister.com/2019/04/05/aaf-goes-under-inside-the-sudden-collapse-of-the-alliance-of-american-football/,"SAN DIEGO — Three weeks before the Alliance of American Football suspended operations against his wishes, confounding league officials and leaving stunned employees and players stranded and reeling, Charlie Ebersol stood on the sideline at SDCCU Stadium in a blue AAF windbreaker, reveling in the roar of the crowd.

It had been Ebersol’s vision to start a spring football league, one that might complement the NFL instead of compete with it, and in a matter of a year, he’d built one, complete with eight teams, more than 400 players and a slew of major media partners. 


“Everyone seems to forget that in the stories,” Ebersol told the Southern California News Group in March. “We built this league from absolutely nothing. No company behind us, no marketing agency, none of that. Built from scratch.”


But beneath that proud facade, the league’s foundation was cracking. A deal with billionaire investor Tom Dundon meant to bail out the AAF was already becoming its undoing. Team budgets had been slashed to nothing. Bills were left unpaid. Before long, the nascent league would crumble, leaving many who trusted the vision of Ebersol and his co-founders feeling misled and angry. Most still don’t understand exactly why the AAF shuttered. The league’s brass, meanwhile, place the blame firmly on Dundon.

“We started out with a vision that we all believed in,” said Jeff Garner, president of the San Diego Fleet. “We were told – just like our partners were told, our players were told, our coaches were told – that we had funding for three years and that we were going to take a long-term approach to this. We knew we were going to lose money up front, but we were going to focus on the football and the fan experience. That’s what we were told. But an investor backed out, and we made a deal with the devil.”

That night in San Diego, as the Birmingham Iron lined up for a game-winning field goal, no one had any idea the AAF would never return here. The Fleet had struggled to find a foothold in Year 1, often leaving large swaths of open seats in this massive stadium. But now, as a few thousand rose to their feet, the buzz for football in the spring felt palpable.

Ebersol beamed. This was his vision, the league he’d sketched out over pancakes with Pro Football Hall of Fame executive Bill Polian. As the stands emptied for the last time, he lingered on the field, shaking hands with players who hoped the AAF might be their second chance."

The Alliance of American Football has suspended operations with just two weeks left in its inaugural season.

Tom Dundon, the owner of the NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes who pledged a US$250-million investment after the opening week of the AAF season, pulled the plug after grabbing a hold of the AAF gambling app technology and failing to reach an agreement with the NFL Players Association to use NFL practice squad players.

The so-called feeder league for the NFL was founded by television producer Charlie Ebersol and former NFL executive Bill Polian last year and had strong TV ratings out of the gate.

But by week two, Dundon was opening up his wallet to keep the league afloat and has poured in $70 million to date.

The AAF was fighting a massive uphill battle because of the monolithic popularity the National Football League enjoys.

And while some CFL fans were concerned about the emergence of a new football league, we didn’t see many star players leave Canada for the fledgling AAF — unless you count Johnny Manziel."
https://www.americanfootball.ie/news/,"IAFA history was made last Sunday when the first female player took to the field in a kitted competitive fixture. As some people may be aware, until recently women were unable to participate in kitted competitive football. The IAFA believe that no person should be excluded from participating in sport based on their gender and sought clarification on this matter from IFAF. IFAF have confirmed that gender is irrelevant and a person should be judged on their fitness and ability to participate in the sport by their respective coaches. With that in mind, IAFA welcomes women to take part in all aspects of the sport including kitted football.

Speaking after her first game on Irish soil, West Dublin Rhinos player, Morane Senyarich said, “I started playing American Football only a year ago but when moving to Ireland I could not think of any other sport I wanted to engage in. I feel very grateful that the Irish American Football Association gave me the opportunity to play in official competitions, and that the amazing West Dublin Rhinos welcomed me so warmly as a member of their team. The fact that the Irish American Football League in now mixed is an essential step towards offering both gender an equal chance to fully enjoy this sport. I hope that more women will join and that some day a separate women’s league will be created”.

IAFA would like to formally welcome Morane to our league and we hope that this is a major stepping stone in opening the league up to more female participation."
https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/apr/02/san-diego-fleet-alliance-of-american-football-t-o/,"Despite having only two regular season games remaining, the San Diego Fleet and the other seven teams in the Alliance of American Football apparently suspended all operations Tuesday, according to multiple reports.

Pro Football Talk reported rumblings of the league's demise Monday night, followed by the Action Network's Darren Rovell.

Tom Dundon, the league's majority owner and the owner of the Carolina Hurricanes hockey team, raised the specter of closing the league in an interview last week with USA Today.

Representatives of the San Diego Fleet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The San Diego squad was scheduled to play the Orlando Apollos on Saturday before closing the regular season at home April 14 against the Arizona Hotshots. At 3-5, the Fleet needed to win out to have a chance at making the playoffs as one of the top two teams in the league's Western Conference.

The fledgling league was only eight weeks into its first season, but faced immediate and future questions of funding and where each team's players would come from. AAF co-founders Charlie Ebersol and Bill Polian intended to run the league independently for three years, with each season coming as a reprieve for football-starved fans during the NFL offseason. Ebersol and Polian planned to eventually form a partnership with the NFL as a developmental league.

According to Rovell and others, Dundon, who purchased a majority stake in the league in February, wanted to form that partnership this season and pressured the NFL Players Association to share players on NFL practice squads. Dundon argued the league could not survive without NFL support.

The NFLPA balked at the rushed relationship and the NFL's collective bargaining agreement made some of his demands impossible. Dundon apparently chose to suspend the league rather than continue committing money to it. Pro Football Talk reported Monday night that the league required $20 million to make it through the April 27 championship game.

The Fleet played its games at SDCCU Stadium, with estimated turnouts growing to nearly 20,000 by season's end. The Fleet also led the league in merchandise sales."

""Last night, a source told PFT that the AAF needed roughly $20 million to get to the end of its first season,"" NBC Sports reported. ""Instead, the season will end with two weeks left in the regular season, and with a four-team postseason that never comes to fruition.""

AAF co-founder Bill Polian says he's been told football operations have been suspended and that virtually everyone involved will be terminated within 24 to 48 hours. He declined to say who told him that.

He says the only people to be retained will be equipment managers and others closing facilities.

Polian says he is ""extremely disappointed.""

He said: ""We were headed to a tremendous run of success, beginning with Saturday's game leading into (the NCAA Tournament) on CBS. Our league on the field has prospered and grown. The football's gotten better, and that's a tremendous tribute to the coaches and players and GMs and front office staff and all the other people who have done a phenomenal job.""

Asked why the league was shutting down, Polian said he's heard that ""only that it's about the money. That's all.""

Tuesday night, the Birmingham Iron released a statement on behalf of Head Coach Tim Lewis and General Manager Joe Pendry saying, ""thank you for your support and for believing in us.""

Here is the full statement:

""On behalf of all of us with the Birmingham Iron organization, we were shocked and incredibly disappointed to learn of the Boards' decision to suspend football operations.

Charlie Ebersol and Bill Polian delivered a quality football product that fans nationally were watching on TV, online, and here in Birmingham on each and every game day.

While all startups encounter some challenges, we believed ours could be addressed in the offseason, after a successful completion to our first season.

We were able to bring together rivals in the talent-rich state of Alabama, with players coming together in black, steel grey and silver. The Birmingham Iron promised a brand of football that made Alabama proud. We cannot thank our players, coaches, staff, corporate partners, and especially our fans that supported us from the moment our team was announced in the Magic City. The Birmingham community came together and proved to be some of the best fans in The Alliance.

We hope to be able to share information from The Alliance about ticket refunds in the future.

Thank you for your support and for believing in us."""

The 10-week league will play its Week 8 games this weekend, but there is a chance the plug will be pulled after that, a source told Pro Football Talk on Tuesday night.

The league is in danger of folding because of a lack of cooperation from the NFL Players’ Association to use NFL players, according to the league’s majority owner, Tom Dundon.

The NFL has expressed a willingness to allow players who sign “futures” contracts after the end of a given season to play in the AAF. Nevertheless, the NFLPA has not yet agreed to the terms of what would amount to a modification of the labor deal between the NFL and the union.

“If the players union is not going to give us young players, we can’t be a development league,” Dundon told USA Today on Wednesday. “We are looking at our options, one of which is discontinuing the league.”

Dundon, the owner of the NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes, invested $250 million last month to help keep the new league afloat.

The NFLPA has not responded to the charge the AAF is in danger of folding because of the union’s lack of cooperation.

A union official told USA Today the NFLPA is concerned NFL teams would use the AAF as a chip to push younger players and practice squad members, eager to make a positive impression, into the developmental league in order for them to be considered for an NFL job the following season.

The official also said it could be a risk to their safety regarding rest and recovery time, and could violate the collective bargaining agreement. The CBA has restrictions that prevent teams from holding mandatory workouts and practices throughout the offseason.

Long story short, if this sticking point isn’t solved the AAF could dissolve before the Final Four begins, and Johnny Manziel’s time in the league could be over after just two weeks."

In an interview published Wednesday, Dundon, who invested $250 million into the league last month, said the NFLPA is refusing to allow the first-year league to use young NFL players.

Atlanta's squad joined the startup league full of optimism, with former head coach Brad Childress hired to lead a group of former Peach State stars, with Atlanta Falcons icon Michael Vick handling the offensive coordinator duties. University of Georgia record-holder Aaron Murray was expected to start at quarterback, with games being played inside Georgia State University's new football stadium.

Things quickly derailed, though.

Childress abruptly resigned on Jan. 9, during training camp, and just prior to the first Week 1 snaps, Vick moved from his coaching role to a player development position within the league. Murray, meanwhile, began the season as a backup to Matt Simms, son of two-time Super Bowl champion Phil Simms. Murray eventually took over as starter and helped the team to its only two victories thus far, though his stats are underwhelming, throwing twice as many interceptions as touchdowns — 6 to 3.

A loss this week at Birmingham would eliminate the Legends from playoff contention. The team have one home game remaining on the schedule, against Salt Lake on April 9. The team ends the season a week later in Memphis, where its possible Johnny Manziel, the controversial former Heisman Trophy winner, will see time at quarterback.

It later became clear that Dundon, who owns the Carolina Hurricanes, was funding the league on a week-to-week basis, with his approximate total commitment being $70 million to this point.

After the deal with Dundon, sources say it became clear to league co-founders Charlie Ebersol and Bill Polian that Dundon’s objectives were different from the original plan.

Ebersol and Polian’s plan was to develop the league for three years on its own before becoming a feeder system to the NFL. Dundon, however, wanted to create that minor league immediately and sought to use the leverage of folding the AAF to get a deal with the NFL Players Association to better insure a flow between leagues.

https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/new-troubling-details-emerge-from-the-aafs-folding,"New troubling details have emerged from the folding of the Alliance of American Football league, which announced the disappointing news today.

The AAF, which hoped to make waves in the football world with a spring league featuring notable former college players – including Johnny Manziel – suspended all operations today.

“I am extremely disappointed to learn Tom Dundon has decided to suspend all football operations of the Alliance of American Football,” Bill Polian, the league’s co-founder, said in a statement Tuesday. “When Mr. Dundon took over, it was the belief of my co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, and myself that we would finish the season, pay our creditors, and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all.

“The momentum generated by our players, coaches and football staff had us well positioned for future success. Regrettably, we will not have that opportunity."
https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/philadelphia-eagles-are-america-s-football-team-now-trump-s-ncna880691,"Since the late 1970s, the Dallas Cowboys have been known as “America’s Team.” In light of recent Trump White House statements, however, Dallas might want to consider handing that title over to the Philadelphia Eagles.

""The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow,” the White House said in an eleventh-hour statement issued on Monday after learning that only two or three players, owner Jeff Lurie, and mascot Swoop were able (or willing) to meet President Donald Trump, as has become customary for championship teams in the U.S. “They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country. The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better.""

There’s only one problem with this statement: It’s patently false. No one on the Super Bowl championship team took a knee during the national anthem this season. (Although even if they had, so what?) Instead, Trump’s statement was a clear attempt to distract attention away from the fact that Eagles players had snubbed him. The presidential ego strikes again.

Trump is slandering athletes who are exactly the kinds of role models Americans need today.

Whether or not you agree with their decision, Eagles players aren't required to attend the White House ceremony. Torrey Smith, one player who had planned to skip the ceremony, laid out a clear and concise argument for his decision to skip it during an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon in February.

“For me, it’s not just about politics,” Smith said. “If I told you that I was invited to a party by an individual I believe is sexist, or has no respect for women, or I told you that this individual has said offensive things toward many minority groups and I don’t feel comfortable about it — this individual also called my peers and my friends SOBs — you would understand why I wouldn’t want to go to that party.”

What’s really frustrating, however, is that Trump is slandering athletes who are exactly the kinds of role models Americans need today. Over the past few years, professional athletes — and the NFL in particular — has been rocked by a series of sexual assault and domestic abuse allegations. Commanding huge salaries and wielding tremendous cultural influence, professional athletes seem to be making headlines for all the wrong reasons these days."

https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Comment/Japan-can-t-stop-talking-about-a-violent-American-football-play,"Coaches overlording players has long been a serious issue in Japanese sports. But earlier this month, the practice blew up into a full-blown scandal.

In an American football game against Kwansei Gakuin University, a defensive end from Nihon University came in after the referee had whistled the play dead and took a below-the-waist dive at the quarterback who had just thrown an incomplete pass and was letting his momentum carry him toward the sideline, his back to the approaching danger.

It was an illegal and violent hit that left the 19-year-old quarterback with a concussion and cervical sprain -- the kind of injuries passengers get when the car they are in gets hit from behind.

The 20-year-old defensive end blamed himself for delivering the hit. But he also blamed himself for not being strong enough to refuse a coaching order to do whatever he could on that very first play of the game to get the quarterback.

The university quickly denied that coaches gave any such order.

The incident has struck a chord in Japan, a nation where company employees often feel as though they are thrust into unethical corporate cultures by bosses who are always ready to take the credit when things go right, just not responsibility when they go wrong. 

Even Japanese who do not follow sports are talking about the violent nature of the hit and what brought it on.

At a press conference, the player, Taisuke Miyagawa, said instructions to deliver the hit had come down from head coach Masato Uchida.

When asked if he had heard the referee's whistle, Miyagawa answered, ""I knew the quarterback had already thrown the ball."" This is an important fact that could be used to file a criminal complaint against the player.

But Miyagawa is not running from the consequences. Instead, he is speaking up, ready to take responsibility for the hit. He called the press conference himself.

A Nihon University official said ""a gap between coaches' instructions and player's perception"" is to blame, an explanation that seems unlikely to hold.

 ""I told the player to crush the opposing quarterback,"" defensive line coach Tsutomu Inoue said, ""but I didn't mean to purposefully injure him.""

To many Japanese who have joined the debate, though, these words are resonating like excuses, as though the coach is bracing for a possible criminal investigation.

Last season, Nihon University won the championship of Japanese college American football, the first time it has managed to do so in 27 years. Miyagawa, who also played for Japan's national team, performed well in the final game, and it was Uchida's first championship as a college football head coach."
https://news.gallup.com/poll/224864/football-americans-favorite-sport-watch.aspx,"The 9% of Americans who mention baseball as their favorite sport to watch is the lowest percentage for the sport since Gallup first asked the question in 1937. Americans named baseball as the most popular sport in 1948 and 1960, but football claimed the top spot in 1972 and has been the public's favorite ever since.

Soccer now nearly matches baseball's popularity. Seven percent say it is their favorite sport to watch, the highest that sport has registered to date. Only once before have at least 7% of Americans named a sport other than football, basketball or baseball as their favorite -- and that was auto racing in 1997. (Auto racing is now down to 2% of mentions.)

Though football retains its top spot, its popularity has slipped since peaking at 43% in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, it dipped slightly to 41% and dropped again to 39% in 2013 -- the last time the question was asked before the December 2017 poll and its 37% reading.

Among the possible reasons for the drop in recent years:

In 2014, a video of National Football League star running back Ray Rice punching his wife and dragging her unconscious body from an elevator shocked the nation. It pushed the already-simmering issue of NFL players' domestic assaults into national prominence, sparking protests and calls for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to resign.
Numerous studies dating back to the 1990s had documented the physical and mental toll concussions were taking on football players at all levels. One of the studies inspired the movie Concussion, released nationwide in 2015.
Protests by NFL players during the pregame playing of the U.S. national anthem in 2016 and 2017 drew strong criticism from President Donald Trump and conservative pundits.
With the national-anthem controversy in full swing this past October, a Gallup poll indicated the NFL was taking a hit. Fifty-seven percent of Americans said they were fans of professional football, down 10 percentage points from the previous time the question was asked, in December 2012. Support for most other sports, including college football, had not changed meaningfully during the same five-year span.

Football Leads Among All Groups, but Some Like It Less Than Others

Women were less likely than men to pick football as their favorite sport even before the issue of players' assaults on women exploded in 2014, and that still holds true. Conservatives, in spite of the national-anthem protests the last two years, are only slightly less likely than moderates to favor football, and are more likely to do so than liberals. Parents of children under 18, who might be expected to be most affected by the publicity surrounding concussion risks football players face, are about as likely as others to pick football as their favorite.

Meanwhile, those who determine the future of spectator sports -- 18- to 34-year-olds -- are the age group least likely to favor football. But even among them, football tops all other sports by a comfortable margin. Soccer and baseball show meaningful differences by age, with soccer appealing more to adults younger than 55 and baseball more to adults aged 55 and older."

Depositions for Kaepernick's case are already underway and will include NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and several owners and coaches throughout the league.The Alliance will, however, support philanthropic and social issues important to their players through involvement in the community and will roll out partnerships with their teams, coaches and players in the coming months and throughout the season, the source added.

The NFL, meanwhile, has no official policy on what players can and cannot do during the national anthem but have had ongoing discussions over the past year on how to handle such matters."

NEW YORK, March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Television and film producer Charlie Ebersol, Pro Football Hall of Famer Bill Polian, four-time All-Pro Jared Allen and two-time Super Bowl champions Justin Tuck and Troy Polamalu, today announced The Alliance of American Football, set to kick off on February 9, 2019.

The eight-team, single-entity structured league will feature high-quality professional football and forge a dynamic alliance between fans, players and the game. Fans will be able to stream Alliance matchups live via the free Alliance app, in a first for professional football while also accessing integrated fantasy options with real rewards -- for themselves and the players they are cheering on. Television partner CBS will air Alliance matchups, beginning with the season opener and culminating with the championship game on the weekend of April 26-28, 2019, with a regular-season game airing each week exclusively on CBS Sports Network.

The Alliance Vision
""The Alliance of American Football represents a fundamental shift in the way we approach professional sports,"" said Charlie Ebersol, founder and CEO of The Alliance of American Football. ""We believe fans and players are what's most important, so our approach is simple -- we've created an Alliance where fans and players share in the success of their teams.""

""Players have our commitment that we will seek the highest degree of safety and our support as we continue to invest in their success off the field with post-football career scholarships and financial wellness programs,"" Ebersol added. ""With the expertise of Bill Polian and a leadership team of respected former All-Pro players and executives, we are committed to putting the best football product possible on the field every weekend, ensuring that 2018 will be the final year fans have to experience a six-month period without football.""

With a lineup of key investors that includes Founders Fund, Slow Ventures, The Chernin Group, Adrian Fenty and Charles King's M Ventures, Keith Rabois and former All-Pro Jared Allen, The Alliance will bring a new business model to the forefront of professional sports.

Real, High-Quality Professional Football
The Alliance will feature eight teams with 50-player rosters, built primarily through regionally based allocation in the fall. Players will be available in markets near where they played in the NFL or college. Eight Alliance cities and their respective coaches will be announced in their local markets over the next 12 weeks.

""There is a significant amount of football talent looking to begin or extend their professional careers. The Alliance will provide those players with a new opportunity to compete at a high level,"" said Bill Polian, co-founder of The Alliance of American Football. ""Our players and fans are the lifeblood of The Alliance, and we will treat them as such.""

""We will give players an opportunity to flourish on the field while establishing plans to support their personal and professional growth, health, safety and financial well-being,"" Polian added. ""This is our commitment to them and will result in an exciting pro football product on the field that fans across the nation and in our markets can rally around.""

The Alliance will introduce several rule changes designed to enhance excitement, increase the safety and accelerate the pace and tempo of games, while maintaining the integrity of the sport that millions of people around the world love:

Player Safety

Eliminating kickoffs and allowing the offense to start on the 25 yard line
In place of the onside kick, the trailing team will receive the ball on their own 35 yard line facing fourth down and 10.

https://www.davisenterprise.com/uncategorized/first-season-will-likely-be-the-last-for-new-football-league/,"As someone who loves the game of football, I don’t know whether to file this “exciting news” in the Sure-to-Fail folder or the Here-They-Go-Again folder.
“Alliance of American Football to kick off after Super Bowl,” said the intriguing headline in The Washington Post, tossing red meat to football fans everywhere.
“A whole new football season will start right after the next Super Bowl,” the story began.
“A spring professional league, the Alliance of American Football, will kick off its inaugural regular season Feb. 9, 2019, and will include a modest broadcast deal with CBS, league executives announced.”
What the story failed to say is that not only will 2019 be the first season of the Alliance of American Football, it will also be the last.
“ ‘This spring football is a massive gap in the market,’ founder Charlie Ebersol said in a news conference. ‘This is a marketplace for tens of millions of Americans who have been telling us for decades that they want to see high-quality football longer than the football season.’ “
According to the brains behind this bad idea, the new league will feature eight teams and a 10-game regular-season schedule.
Adding fuel to the football fire, cbssports.com reports that the Ol’ Ball Coach himself, Steve Spurrier, has been hired to coach the Orlando franchise. However, which cities have been selected for the other seven franchises remains a mystery.
I’ll take a wild guess and say Boise, Fargo, Albuquerque, Mobile, Austin, Spokane and Saskatoon.
All of those cities are dying for a professional franchise of some sort, even if it’s with a league that’s flat-out dead on arrival.
Remember when the Canadian Football League tried to expand into the lower 48? Do the Sacramento Gold Miners come to mind?
Remember the XFL, which promised a more exciting and fan-friendly product than the NFL, but ended up one-and-done in 2001?
The problem with these new leagues is not that people don’t want more football. Most of us would welcome a 20-game NFL regular season or a college game that runs a month or two longer.
Major League Baseball plays a 162-game schedule and every team in the NBA plays 82 games, plus the playoffs.
Obviously, if NFL teams had 162-game schedules, there’d be no players left after the first 20 or 30 games, but that doesn’t mean diehard fans don’t want more football.
The real problem is that these new leagues always want to reinvent a game that people already love. Just give us a spring league that plays with the exact same rules as either the NFL or the college game and we’ll be happy as clams in the sand. Please, don’t tinker with success.
The XFL changed so many rules and showed games with so many dizzying camera angles that you had to take Dramamine to make it through an entire game without throwing up.
And now the Alliance of American Football is making the same mistake.
The new league has eliminated kickoffs, one of the most exciting plays in the sport on those times when the ball doesn’t sail out of the end zone.
The point-after-touchdown kick has been eliminated in favor of a mandatory two-point conversion, which misses the point entirely.
The reason the two-point conversion is so popular with fans is that it is a gamble. It involves risk. Go for the sure thing or go for two. You can’t be a riverboat gambler if the rules require you to go for two points after every touchdown.
There will be no onside kicks, another exciting play that has turned games around with one bad bounce.
Now the trailing team that scores will be given the ball at its own 35-yard-line facing a fourth-and-10 situation. Which is just plain silly.
There will also be a 30-second play clock in an attempt to reduce games to two-and-a-half hours, so you get far less bang for your buck. If the game is scintillating, absolutely no one objects to a three-hour contest.
“Hey, let’s go to an AAF game. We’ll pay our money and then get out of there in a jiffy.”
The Alliance for American Football. Even Steve Spurrier can’t save it."
https://www.cardiachill.com/2019/1/31/18204722/alliance-american-football-aaf-pitt-panthers-football-dontez-ford-san-diego-fleet-orlando-apollos,"The Alliance of American Football is in its infancy as a league, and for the first time in its history, its teams trimmed their rosters down to 52 men and finalized them for the start of the season. The personnel decisions of the eight AAF teams were made public on Wednesday, and six former Pitt players made the cut.

Tight end Scott Orndoff secured a spot on the roster of the Orlando Apollos, and offensive lineman Jaryd Jones-Smith was able to do the same with the San Antonio Commanders. However, the highest concentration of former Panthers was on the roster of the San Diego Fleet, as wide receiver Dontez Ford, offensive lineman Brandon Hodges, defensive lineman Shakir Soto and punter Ryan Winslow were all listed among the team’s 52 players.

Of the four Pitt products in San Diego, Winslow is the only one who will take the field unopposed, as he is the Fleet’s lone punter. But it appears much is also expected of Ford, and he could see plenty of playing time.

Ford stood out early in the team’s training camp in San Antonio, as he made a diving catch during a morning practice session on Jan. 5 that brought his teammates on the sideline to their feet. He was later praised by Fleet head coach Mike Martz for his route running on Jan. 12 before coming up with another impressive grab during seven-on-seven drills. Fleet wide receivers coach Az-Zahir Hakim spoke optimistically about what Ford brings to the table last week.

“I think he’s going to help us big time,” Hakim said, according to Jeff Goldberg of AAF.com. “He’s strong to the ball. He’s very detail-oriented. He asks a lot of questions. He always wants to get better and improve each day. That’s his mindset, and that type of attitude is going to help this team in the long run.”

With that said, it’s unclear what Ford’s status is, as he missed practice Tuesday due to a knee injury. The severity of the issue is unclear, but he showed resilience by bouncing back from a hamstring injury during training camp.

The San Diego Fleet will face the San Antonio Commanders on the road on the AAF’s opening night. That game will get underway at the Alamodome at 8 p.m. ET on Feb. 9. At the same time, the Orlando Apollos will be hosting the Atlanta Legends at Spectrum Stadium."

Jack Kiser, a quarterback/linebacker who is headed to play at Notre Dame next year, rushed for 44 touchdowns and also had 18 two-point conversions to give him 312 points on the season. He led Pioneer (Royal Center, Ind.) to a 15-0 record and the Class 1A state championship while also helping his team score a national best 936 points. Kiser finished his career with 920 points, making him the No. 2 all-time leading scorer in Indiana history. He also ranks as the No. 4 rusher in Indiana history with 7,364 yards.

Kiser was also a standout on defense, racking up 159 tackles on defense with seven interceptions. He helped lead a defense that posted 11 shutouts and gave up only 39 points all season.

For his performance, Kiser has been selected as the MaxPreps Small Schools National Player of the Year. Kiser was also the Player of the Year by the IndyStar, marking the first time a Class 1A player has ever been chosen as the state Player of the Year by the newspaper.

Kiser heads the 64-member All-American team, which consists of players who compete for schools that play in state enrollment divisions that generally have fewer than 1,000 students.

Chaminade-Madonna (Hollywood, Fla.), which won the Florida Class 3A state championship and finished as the No. 1 team in the MaxPreps Small Schools National Rankings, had four players on the team while Greater Atlanta Christian (Norcross, Ga.), Amite (La.), Christian Academy-Louisville (Ky.) and Farrell (Pa.) each had two."
https://www.newsobserver.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/luke-decock/article226452965.html,"Not content merely with owning a professional team, Tom Dundon is buying a professional league.

The Carolina Hurricanes owner was named chairman of the new Alliance of American Football on Tuesday after stepping in with a $250 million investment to become the league’s primary investor, and the question most pressing in this market has nothing to do with football: How will it affect the Hurricanes?

“It won’t at all,” Dundon said. “Although I talk to (general manager) Don Waddell and I’m involved, I don’t have a day-to-day responsibility and therefore I have lots of excess time. If I didn’t do this, I was going to go buy a company and start running a company again. I needed more to do. I feel like the Hurricanes are in good hands, the business is running well. It’s still something I love and have conversations about and want to keep improving, but it’s not a full-time job. It never really was. It definitely isn’t at this point.”

While that may slightly downplay Dundon’s role in the hockey team’s decision-making process, where he has the final say on just about everything and is in near-constant communication with Waddell and the rest of the front-office staff, only he knows just how much spare time he has. Dundon said he had initially passed on investing in the AAF, but reconsidered after seeing the first-weekend ratings when it ran into financing issues. With football guidance from Dallas friends Tony Romo and Troy Aikman, Dundon stepped in to take control of the single-entity league, which owns all eight teams and assigns all players, much like MLS did at its inception.

https://crayfishnews.com/2019/02/18/editorial-bring-alliance-of-american-football-to-shreveport/,"Shreveport, LA – The past two weekends, as you were perusing the sport channels and cracking open a tall, cool Budweiser, you may have noticed scores for the new Alliance of American Football (AAF). Fans of the old USFL will probably be excited by the new league and rightfully so. With all the bad calls and non-football related issues with the NFL, it’s time to get back to basics. Several cities throughout the nation have new teams like the Arizona Hotshots, San Antonio Commanders, and the Birmingham Iron. So, we here at the Crayfish wondered, “If a backwater town like Birmingham can have a new football team, why can’t Shreveport?”. 
Shreveport has never done well with local sport teams. The amount of guano at Fairgrounds Field can attest to that. Pirates, Captains, Swamp Dragons, ABA Mavericks, and the Battlewings have all fallen on their faces. The only thing left standing is the Mudbugs and even they are not the same as they were ten years ago.  However, with a newly elected mayor who is enthusiastic about turning things around, perhaps bringing in a new football team could help getting Shreveport that facelift she oh-so needs. To to get the ball rolling on something like this, we need to find a name that would befit a team from Shreveport, LA. We sat down to work feverishly through the night to come up with some names that would best represent our southern oasis and here is what we were able to come up with:"
https://www.boston.com/sports/nfl/2019/02/10/what-is-the-aaf-a-look-at-the-new-football-leagues-rules-founders-and-future,"Although there are several significant differences between the AAF and the NFL, the game as a whole shouldn’t be too far off what you’re used to seeing on Sundays.

Instead of kickoffs, which the league decided slow down the game and create too many injuries, the ball will simply start on the 25-yard line after each score or at the beginning of each half.
Instead of kicking an extra point, teams have to attempt a two-point conversion after every touchdown.
Onside kicks have been replaced by an onside conversion. If a team is trailing by 17 points, or there is five minutes or less left in the fourth quarter, they can opt to get the ball on their own 28-yard line and try to convert a 4th-and-12.
There will be no TV timeouts and fewer full-screen commercials. Additionally, there will be a sky judge referee who can communicate with the officials on the field in real-time so the refs won’t have to go under the hood.
In overtime, each team will get the ball at the opposing 10-yard line. They’ll have one possession to score a touchdown, then attempt a two-point conversion. The game will end in a tie if neither team scores.
Each player in the nascent league signed the same deal: a three-year, $250,000 contract with an option to opt-out if the NFL comes calling during the offseason. The AAF will also offer secondary education scholarships and an internship program.

The players were allocated to their teams by region based on where they played college football or last played with an NFL or CFL club. For the quarterbacks, a four-round draft was held that allowed teams to protect one player from their region or pick from the entire pool.

The people involved
The AAF was announced in March 2018 by co-founders Charlie Ebersol and Bill Polian.

Ebersol, a filmmaker, is a son of Dick Ebersol, the former NBC Sports president who co-founded the short-lived XFL with WWE chairman Vince McMahon.

Polian was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015 after a long career as an NFL executive. Patriots fans might recall that he has a history of influencing rule changes; after Bill Belichick’s defense manhandled the Indianapolis Colts’ offense in 2004, Polian — then the Colts’ president — prodded the NFL until it restricted what defenders could do to receivers downfield."
https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/american-football-lp3-new-album-interview-767361/,"In 2016, American Football had to relearn how to be a band. Surrounded by belated critical praise and an intense fandom, the beloved emo act reunited after a 15-year-long absence to record their sophomore album, a record that aimed to recreate their original blend of confessional lyrics and gentle math rock. But in doing so, all four members realized there was much more to explore — but they had to be patient.

During the years that followed, all four members — singer and guitarist Mike Kinsella, guitarist Steve Holmes, drummer and horn player Steve Lamos, and bassist Nate Kinsella — began trading demos, slowly building off one another’s ideas from afar until a pattern appeared: slower pacing, extended outros, and less chaos. This modern iteration of American Football has one foot in Midwestern emo and another in lush dream pop. The result is American Football, the band’s third album, out March 22nd on Polyvinyl."
http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/feb/13/new-aaf-gives-former-area-players-another-chance-a/,"Matt Linehan isn’t the highest-paid player on the Salt Lake Stallions’ 52-man roster.

He isn’t fighting for scraps on the startup organization’s payroll, either.

The former Idaho quarterback gets the same paycheck as everyone else on his Alliance of American Football roster, part of the new professional spring football league backed by some of the NFL’s most recognizable figures.

Linehan doesn’t get a dime more than Stallions punter Austin Rehkow, the former Central Valley and Idaho standout who’s back in pads after preseason stints with the Buffalo Bills and New York Giants.

The eight-team league kicked off its inaugural season to a national audience Saturday – the opening game on CBS drew 2.9 million viewers, according to reports – and showed off a quality brand of football that aims to complement the NFL while having its own identity and sustainability.

Linehan likened the AAF to the NBA’s G-League, but without the money-driven politics.

“We’re not a direct affiliate (of an NFL team), but it’s for players that were the one man out on a roster cut, didn’t have a lot of hype in college,” said Linehan, who led the Sun Belt Conference in passing in 2016 with Idaho.

“And we’re getting paid the same, so there’s no, ‘Oh, hey, we drafted this guy high and are paying him a lot, so he needs to play’ sort of thing.”

Not that the league isn’t dotted with big names."
