The financial fallout could much severe Germany new allegation provide ammunition shareholder battling carmaker court Investors Germany say Volkswagen neglected legal obligation inform risk taking As result shareholder say lost billion euro cheating came light Volkswagens stock plunged value
The German lawsuit turn question Mr Winterkorn member Volkswagens management board knew socalled defeat device software could recognize diesel vehicle tested emission
When software detected car emission tested pollution control cranked But normal driving condition software reduced control minimize engine wear As result Volkswagen Audi Porsche diesel produced far harmful nitrogen oxide pollution legally allowed
If investor prove Mr Winterkorn knew scheme 2007 damage claim much stronger Fines legal settlement arising diesel scandal already cost Volkswagen world No 1 maker vehicle last year 33 billion
It could grave consequence matter German court said Christian Strenger shareholder activist corporate governance expert among suing Volkswagen Germany
In suit SEC describes meeting November 2007 emission issue main topic discussion Mr Winterkorn highranking manager attended meeting coincided Volkswagens preparation major push regain market share United States advertising clean diesel
But engineer trouble taming nitrogen oxide emission meet American emission standard A presentation meeting detailed plan conceal excess emission diesel car United States including use defeat device center scheme
Volkswagen said 2017 evidence Mr Winterkorn seen 2007 presentation The SEC suit official document based information gathered investigator contradicts

Volkswagen admitted 11 million vehicle equipped software used cheat emission test This technology work mean vehicle owner
Volkswagen said statement raised money sophisticated investor got principal interest back SEC piling try extract company The company noted recent annual report suit possible SEC requested information related potential violation security law
It seemed recently Volkswagens legal trouble United States mostly behind The company paid 23 billion fine civil settlement diesel owner federal government state government dealer United States
A 147 billion settlement resolved claim owner arising dieselcheating scandal one largest consumer classaction settlement ever United States
Although Volkswagen generally preferred settle case United States combative response SEC suit filed federal court San Francisco suggests gearing fight could drag weigh finance image

College sport upside But sheer scale silly
By David Leonhardt

This article part David Leonhardts newsletter You sign receive weekday
At 1115 local time Des Moines morning March Madness begin earnest The men basketball team University Minnesota University Louisville playing It first 16 game today another 80 men woman game take place next several day
In couple recent newsletter Ive written downside college sport big one Today I want talk upside college sport might able achieve better balance
I assume many filled March Madness bracket friend family colleague Those bracket give excuse fun together Some also fortunate enough big rooting interest one team still playing Maybe youll watch game together exchange nervous text game final moment Maybe youll end jumping around house joy point next couple week kid sibling
Listen The Argument podcast every Thursday morning Ross Douthat Michelle Goldberg David Leonhardt
College sport bring people lot joy As one college roommate texted last week way objecting recent criticism sport Im happier basketball team good Hes got point Sports create shared experience way activity country
This communal function mean college good reason treat athlete differently applicant Yes college make sure theyre admitting athlete academic preparation graduate But I understand basketball player representing University Minnesota today dont necessarily need academic qualification student oboist journalist Minnesota Those athlete bring something campus student
Why world
But important remember something else Most college sport dont look anything like basketball They dont bring lot people together Their crowd small They dont many spillover benefit part university They exist largely benefit athlete make different many extracurricular activity
And sport often disproportionately played white relatively welloff student They dont add much diversity campus Only 4 percent male college lacrosse player black Justin Wolfers University Michigan noted Only 5 percent fencer In golf share 2 percent In water polo 1 percent
Yet college treat athlete sport entirely different specie applicant The athlete dont need nearly strong application student
Because many sport exist share athlete college shockingly high Roughly 20 percent onefifth entering class Ivy League university leading small liberal art college recruited athlete Jonathan Cole top former official Columbia University college athlete written Why world school using 20 percent slot recruited athlete The answer Cole explains sport become kind arm race
In recent newsletter I mentioned one five student Williams College western Massachusetts athlete according outside estimate That turn wrong conservative Williams high end distribution 30 percent student recruited athlete according college
Cole right situation doesnt make sense I fully aware fencer golfer water polo player athlete work extremely hard But many student participate extracurricular activity superior academic record Those student often rejected make room athlete The problem special treatment many athlete receiving
In better system college would substantially shrink number athlete recruit Each would keep modest number sport split equally men woman would recruit athlete still give huge admission bonus
These wouldnt team college fielded But sport would follow classic scholarathlete model The member team would longer receive extraspecial treatment admission process They would student happened athlete And would compete team filled similar athlete
Is college brave enough move direction

The extension first reported ESPN would establish Trout highestpaid baseball player annual basis topping 344 million Zack Greinke earning Arizona Diamondbacks sixyear 2065 million contract signed December 2015
From 2017 Mike Trout Baseballs Best Without Brand
While enormous amount money even recordbreaking contract doesnt necessarily bring Trout highest tier overall income professional athlete
While comparing contract across sport continent inherently difficult undertaking varied contractual structure tax burden bonus ancillary benefit clear even monster deal Trout would fall well short becoming world highest paid athlete annually
The soccer superstar Lionel Messi example expected earn 106 million euro 120 million per year Barcelona 2021 amount could rise 120 million euro certain incentive met The boxer Canelo Álvarez earn least 73 million annually fiveyear deal streaming service DAZN

Natalie Morales Parks Recreation White Collar star Abby exMarine turn backyard neighborhood watering hole array quirky regular including Neil Flynn The Middle Nelson Franklin Veep Jessica Chaffin Search Party pas evening tee one anothers punch line
Its basic setup undergirded number workplace show comedy based improvised family This includes perhaps greatest sitcom Cheers also happens series bar comedy measured

At first glance Schur would seem unlikely choice multicamera sitcom classic form generally consisting actor performing contained set multiple camera studio audience defined TV comedy decade I Love Lucy All In Family The Cosby Show Seinfeld Friends
Schurs tightly serialized philosophically inquisitive The Good Place widely acclaimed narrative ambition earlier filmic singlecamera show worked like The Office Parks Recreation instrumental creating perception multicamera format stagy setup broadly telegraphed joke relic simpler TV era Even CBSs soontodepart Big Bang Theory TVs toprated show much past decade longestrunning multicamera sitcom history went singlecam spinoff Young Sheldon
But Schur intrigued idea Malmuth hopped golf cart drove around Universal lot search ideal spot They found former Wisteria Lane star Desperate Housewives backstabbed frontstabbed actually stabbed way rating gold

The set includes bleacher 100 people provide amount outdoor laugh track episode open noting nod sitcom intro yore Abbys filmed live outdoor audience To reinforce notion camera occasionally pull back commercial break show crowd set
You see audience see like literally side cliff Universal Studios see Los Angeles city light see u weird little outdoor set acting Morales said later Its going feel familiar also going feel novel
Schur said We worried little breaking fourth wall premise multicam constantly breaking fourth wall youre hearing human laughing
Though plenty wellregarded sitcom Malmuth writer producer New Girl Superstore theatrical setting harkens back earlier career Malmuth wrote stage Schur Saturday Night Live
But werent necessarily looking reinvent old format said joint interview shortly shoot another house Wisteria Lane
The objective wasnt let set rejuvenate medium Schur said The objective let execute idea well backing
We dont want stage AstroTurf Malmuth said

Such move would amount big play would send signal seriousness election could potentially appeal liberal activist generalelection voter eager chart safest route toward defeating President Trump But Mr Biden sold either approach carry significant risk chiefly could call attention age candidate would turn 80 White House

Mr Bidens adviser stress still finalizing decision whether run nowhere near determining whether name running mate early And grumble neither Mr Sanders year older Mr Biden 72yearold current occupant Oval Office face amount question age
The former vice president though said question legitimate At speech last fall Mr Biden said totally appropriate people look say I run office Well God darn youre old Well chronologically I old

La invasión anual de los residentes del Medio Oeste unos cuantos canadienses ha disminuido en años recientes pero siguen representando una importante fuerza económica cultural Unos 106000 visitantes invernales gastaron alrededor de 528 millones de dólares en el valle durante la temporada de invierno de 201718 según una encuesta realizada por la Universidad de Texas Valle del Río Grande Los restaurantes texmex montan pancartas para recibirlos Hay periódicos para texanos invernales parques para remolques con restricciones de edad mínima exposiciones cruceros producciones teatrales calcomanías de parachoques Una camioneta en la ciudad fronteriza de McAllen tenía do Texano invernal de Iowa Estoy jubilado Rebásame

La mayoría de los texanos invernales son de raza blanca tienen 70 años más Muchos de ellos votaron por Trump en 2016 su mera presencia contradice la afirmación que hizo el presidente acerca de que la frontera está en crisis Vienen la región desde hace años en algunos casos siguiendo la tradición de sus padre la dinámica política la retórica de la emergencia nacional afecta cómo viven su jubilación ni dónde lo hacen
Nosotros vemos lo que ustedes ven en la televisión dijo Terry Goss director general de Victoria Palms una de la comunidades más grandes de texanos invernales con hasta 2500 jubilados
Qué e exactamente lo que le atrae los texanos invernales
Conocer la vida fronteriza que se parece en nada lo que la mayoría de los estadounidenses imagina que e Un viernes se celebró el cuarto evento benéfico de baile sock hop en el centro Ranchero Village en Weslaco Hubo almuerzos de pescado recorridos en bote por el río baile de cuadrillas sesiones de karaoke conciertos improvisados de bluegrass acústico servicios religiosos ecuménicos
Un lunes por la tarde en el centro vacacional Winter Ranch en Álamo la compañía teatral de Winter Ranch agotó la entradas en su presentación de tres obras de un solo acto The Ethel Albert Comedies En Victoria Palms Goss habló de pie junto un cartel que mostraba todos los espectáculos agotados en el salón de baile del centro uno de ellos era el concierto de una banda tributo The Rolling Stones Victoria Palms e tan popular con los canadienses que casi todos los veranos se programa una reunión de los huéspedes de Victoria Palms cerca de Toronto

No tomamos muchas medicinas así que pensamos Ah vayamos allá compremos un poco de Tylenol Advil cosas así por menos dinero dijo Hitzemann Pensé Cielos esto vale lo mismo en Walmart Así que al final compramos ningún medicamento
En una región con una gran población latina una actitud tolerante hacia la inmigración muchas persona tienen familiares en ambo lados de la frontera el choque cultural con los habitantes del norte e inevitable El estudio publicado por la Universidad de Texas Valle del Río Grande incluyó mensajes sin editar enviados funcionarios locale de parte de texanos invernales Algunos de los comentarios más mordaces decían Sean más estadounidenses menos mexicano No estamos en México Hagan que el canal 5 respete Trump Poden el césped recojan la basura hablen inglés

But people buy one development home cost million dollar landing middle board dispute financial disaster A renovation costly lengthy keeping property fresh hurt real estate value development newer amenity spring Throw legal battle cost rise quickly
Most battle happen condo power grab said Rebecca S Trinkler lawyer Buchanan Ingersoll Rooney There dispute board member seen taking advantage position

Scott Diffenderfer broker real estate agency Compass bought condo Nine Island Avenue clash figured dispute would eventually resolved But took several year said
Florida Wild West stuff said There many condo youd think theyd figure havent

Bigmoney battle also mean resident become innocent bystander dispute dont care
Ms Trinkler said buyer research board member understand type assessment levied past
You ask people theyre happy board run really inquire condition building managed said Even still might know youre going get least sense
Looking leap important organizing coup winning costly litigation battle association rare More often lot money spent feeling friendship damaged board way

Sometimes however resident win battle In motherinlaws community group challenging assessment prevailed It ousted board halted assessment set aside renovation Moreover without incurring hundred thousand dollar legal bill

A Dow spokesman said shift policy unrelated 1 million contribution The new approach result better understanding pesticide used said Gregg M Schmidt Corteva spokesman
Spokesmen FMC Adama primary maker pesticide studied well lawyer CropLife America trade group represents declined comment
Asked Mr Bernhardts intervention appropriate motivated desire serve industry interest Interior Department spokeswoman said action governed solely legitimate concern regarding legal sufficiency policy
Before joined Trump administration Mr Bernhardt worked lawyer lobbyist representing client including oil gas industry He frequently paid challenge endangered speciesrelated matter including one involving tiny silvery blue fish called delta smelt whose protection federal government resulted limit water use California farmer
Agency record suggest Mr Bernhardt limited involvement issue nine meeting call schedule Fish Wildlife staff October November 2017 helped write letter saying Interior Department longer prepared release draft
Wendy ClelandHamnett EPA official time ran office charge toxic chemical pesticide said sudden change regulatory philosophy part broader trend across government Mr Trumps election
It certainly similar pattern saw toxic chemical well regulated industry sympathetic ear new administration said Ms Hamnett left EPA late 2017 38year career agency And resulted shift approach issue would handled
Gary Frazer top endangered specie official Fish Wildlife Service whose schedule say participated nine late 2017 discussion Mr Bernhardt subsequently directed staff revise study said believe change direction politically driven
It entirely appropriate role said interview two agency public affair official listened There armtwisting kind
The endangered specie review required part reregistration pesticide process occurs every 15 year
Experts Fish Wildlife Service Commerce Departments National Marine Fisheries Service supposed determine pesticide might jeopardize continued existence endangered specie threatened specie result destruction adverse modification habitat specie standard created federal law
Much work focus question like whether wildfire management program Florida Everglades hurt endangered specie American crocodile West Indian manatee The Fish Wildlife Service rarely make socalled jeopardy finding 2015 study nearly 7000 case found two concluded finding specie jeopardy
The pesticide industry well group representing farmer rely product began mobilize endangered specie review got underway Obama administration
With Mr Trumps election industry escalated campaign In April 2017 lawyer sent letter Ryan Zinke interior secretary Scott Pruitt EPAs administrator commerce secretary Wilbur Ross asking direct effort prepare biological opinion process called set aside arguing analysis fundamentally flawed
The industry central argument federal scientist sufficiently taking account difference pesticide could legally used actually used
Staff member Fish Wildlife Service email show access actual pesticide usage well information measurement pesticide concentration found salmonbearing stream Washington State
But agency staff working dozen field office like Hawaii Maine well headquarters generally built prediction jeopardy threat endangered specie assuming pesticide used maximum extent possible allowed label
That unlike type product label pesticide label legally enforceable according EPA policy And historic usage data agency staff said document sufficient predict pesticide might used cause harm coming 15 year
The pesticide particularly chlorpyrifos malathion high toxicity animal effect endangered specie would direct indirect via contamination food source example staff concluded The EPA separately considered banning chlorpyrifos potential harm human
The Fish Wildlife staff cited San Joaquin kit fox tiny animal weighs five pound slim body large ear long bushy tail Decades ago inhabited large part Californias San Joaquin Valley area today intensive farming pesticide use But fox population gone part pesticide like diazinon contaminated bird grass fox fed agency concluded
The Cape Sable seaside sparrow another endangered specie located mostly Florida found jeopardy result drifting spray chlorpyrifos For many vulnerable specie single exposure could catastrophic October 2017 summary staff finding said

The team concluded chlorpyrifos put 1399 specie mixture animal plant jeopardy malathion put 1284 jeopardy diazinon third pesticide evaluated placed 175 specie jeopardy There 1663 specie listed endangered threatened United States meaning two pesticide may putting jeopardy This information agency official said accidentally released Freedom Information response obtained The Times They intended keep tally secret assessment final
The agency staff recommending pesticide banned Instead proposing change pesticide could used including possible restriction use area endangered specie found certain time year document say
Lawyers work interior secretary office wanted different approach They advocated abandoning presumption use pesticide farmer golf course might directly cause death harm endangered specie official said
Their argument farmer example manufacture pesticide use mean harm caused indirect effect defined federal law There much higher standard proof needed demonstrate indirect effect harmed endangered specie The law requires harm shown reasonably certain occur The revised approach almost certainly going result fewer plant animal judged jeopardy extinction result continued pesticide use
The shift approach go far beyond single Fish Wildlife Service analysis In early 2018 Mr Pruitt Mr Zinke Mr Ross agreed work toward new framework endangered specie evaluation move CropLife called positive step towards solving important complex issue

On May 10 2017 le 24 hour President Trump fired James Comey FBI director Comey received email man never met The correspondent Matt Latimer began praising Comeys decade faithful service United States government cause law order offering sympathy tumultuous period going Then Latimer got heart matter As head Washington literary agency called Javelin wanted Comey know ever interest writing book wed urge consider possibility wanted Comey client
Javelin prepared invest story Latimer wrote Its least someone given much country
Comey want write book He sent Latimer polite response saying much But several month later began warm idea thought back correspondence Latimer There something tone email Comey recently told I liked tone
Latimer Keith Urbahn Latimers partner Javelin went lunch Comey golf club Their pitch We partner way thats unusual literaryagency business Comey recalled Before literary agent Latimer Urbahn Republican operative viewed book project akin political campaign They told Comey would work proposal shop publisher would also help writing social medium presence publicity called messaging whole project They promised offer brutal feedback time One big challenge place especially Washington getting people tell unvarnished truth especially stink Comey said I knew I could count guy tell I sucked
Comey come around idea writing book wanted said useful wake something bad happening make something good come He envisioned memoir leadership book reflecting lesson learned course long career What want write anything 109 tumultuous day Trumps FBI director I desperate Trump book writer told
Latimer Urbahn gave brutal feedback late We convinced come book doesnt deal thing people want know hell happened room one one Trump youre going leaving major question unanswered people unsatisfied Urbahn said And youre going asked anyway They sold Comey idea storydriven book career including experience Trump word memoir essentially tricked people learning leadership lesson hoped convey Their logic strong Comey said
Comey insisted writing book forgoing ghostwriter leaned heavily Latimer Urbahn editorial assistance The draft sent would come back slashed Comey recalled They vision I didnt They also possessed understanding political medium landscape Comey even publisher lacked We knew minute book came going people criticizing didnt go far enough Latimer said He didnt say Trump Russian agent Theres news Blah blah blah So wanted set book term early
Last March month book publication date Latimer Urbahn Comey tweet Trump Mr President American people hear story soon They hosted gettoknowyou meeting Comey news anchor vying first interview negotiated network primetime slot They briefed reporter background book newsiest bit
When finally arrived bookstore A Higher Loyalty Truth Lies Leadership indeed tell lesson ethical leadership Comey learned rolling Gambino crime family prosecuting Martha Stewart But book final 90 page received attention Comey offered dramatic blowbyblow account FBI investigation Russias effort help Trump 2016 campaign hairraising interaction Trump election Before even reached publication day Urbahn said sold half million copy
One morning February I went see Latimer Urbahn office sits second floor 19thcentury rowhouse Washington suburb Alexandria Va A steady snowfall obscured usual view Potomac River office window Latimer 48 Urbahn 35 dressed weather khaki duck boot like couple prepschool English teacher Their work space feel cozy reading room lot exposed brick shelf crammed book along occasional bottle bourbon Posters client book jacket decorate wall Most typical Washington fare campaign biography Ted Cruz book Nancy Reagan former press secretary reportage essay political journalist pundit
Since A Higher Loyalty published townhouse become popular destination Trump administration official especially contemplating exit way Urbahn told Theyre planning get Latimer chimed Weve met talked probably every major official would know departed thinking departing Trump White House said
Read secretary state Mike Pompeo one last remaining memebers Trumps original White House team
The problem official many White House exit nailed shut The path executive branch highly remunerative privatesector work standard postadministration trajectory better worse recent decade used smooth Barack Obamas press secretary Jay Carney Amazon George W Bushs communication director Dan Bartlett Walmart attest While veteran Trumps State Treasury Departments tended navigate path successfully enough people worked controversial precinct Trump World hard time even getting job interview If publicly traded company CEO doesnt worry blowback shareholder hire someone administration one former senior Trump administration official requested anonymity discus travail friend colleague told They concerned employee going react If company office Silicon Valley New York Los Angeles DC hard play
Latimer Urbahn turned professional abyss market niche Their central insight hoary old fixture Washington selfpromotion tellall may ideal solution new problem postTrump rehabilitation A juicy memoir stand earn former Trump official small fortune thanks unprecedented interest administration intrigue It also give official opportunity reposition redeem A lot trying figure How I make something wellbeing Latimer told But also How I distance guy
After two helped Comey land book advance shy 3 million 2017 Urbahn said people whose entire job basically undermine Comey came u asking u think next step Last year Latimer secured former White House aide Cliff Sims sevenfigure deal book Trump experience Team Vipers published January Now rarely week go Latimer Urbahn dont hear someone administration
As result Latimer Urbahn ceased agent theyve become career counselor life coach The challenge Trump people theyre looking legitimacy theyre looking sort outlet unburden baggage come job Urbahn said Some honest others
They dream Trump author Latimers anonymous senior Trump official wrote OpEd The New York Times last September effort thwart president within administration Urbahns Robert Mueller But Trump figure would dismiss hand I asked would interested representing Rudy Giuliani We pretty much mind probably would meet almost anyone least see Latimer said The question Urbahn added If there money made going feel good helping someone redemption tour
Granted conscience always salved One person came u would know said If I turned Trump book much money could I get Is worth Latimer recalled And like Its hard know tell u everything want say The potential client hesitated many card willing reveal
So Latimer said still talking person
In 1985 Michael Kinsley editor The New Republic colleague visit several Washington bookstore place note deep inside copy three important supposedly well read political book year offering 5 reward anyone found one note No one ever claimed money
The stunt illustrated fundamental truth Washington book While may sell theyre rarely read And would Washington book tend dull design safe campaign memoir senator governor bloodlessly telling rise prepares embark White House run legacyburnishing memoir retired cabinet official recounting equally bloodless tale challenge met competitor bested obstacle overcome
But Washington tellall often exception rule The modern trend book date 1986 David Stockman Ronald Reagans first budget director wrote The Triumph Politics devastating account Reagan White House fundamentally unwilling unable tame government spending Reagan promised ran president Stockman sort administration official previously would le anonymous public But proximity power important willing dish
Stockman professed civic responsibility grown concerned said fiscal consequence Reagan administration supplyside economics But lucrative form responsibility He received 24 million advance book went best seller became foundational text Reagan critic
Some way leave Trump White House
Stockmans deal brokered Robert Barnett lawyer Washington law firm Williams Connolly Barnett former top aide Walter Mondale mostly whitecollar defense work Stockmans book led impressive side hustle He would later handle book deal Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton George W Bush Barack Obama Michelle Obama among others invariably came described press superlawyer Barnett bill client hour rather taking publishing industry standard 15 percent commission bridle called agent
Barnett continued represent political player like Stockman lesser sufficient Washington wattage including former Clinton communication director George Stephanopoulos Bush adviser Karl Rove Obama strategist David Axelrod He also represented Bushs first defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld selling 2011 memoir Known Unknown
But Rumsfeld came back Barnett idea book leadership lesson Rumsfelds Rules Barnett unenthusiastic prospect This rankled Rumsfelds ghostwriter Latimer Urbahn met year earlier speechwriter Rumsfelds office Pentagon Latimer already knew something publishing industry written funny incisive political memoir Speechless time speechwriter Rumsfeld later George W Bush He Urbahn took Rumsfeld first client Rumsfeld got 1 million advance HarperCollins Latimer Urbahn founded Javelin naming agency handle Secret Service given Rumsfelds wife They set sight displacing Barnett king Washington literary hill
For year Barnett looked nose Latimer Urbahn claiming client often people already rejected But Comeys decision sign Javelin suggested Trumps election disrupted Washington literary scene along everything else In initial email Comey pitching Javelins service Latimer wrote We confident beat advance youd receive working agent socalled superlawyer
Barnett isnt exactly hurting business last year No1 Michelle Obama No5 Bob Woodward nonfiction best seller representing former Trump administration official Gary Cohn Nikki Haley forthcoming book But Trump era spelled end nearmonopoly brokering political blockbuster Bob Barnett establishment establishment went one book editor specializes political title worked Barnett Javelin told But look bestseller list day establishment anymore In new paradigm dont need former chief economic adviser former United Nations ambassador former FBI director matter get sevenfigure advance tellall
You could instance Cliff Sims As typical Trump era Simss path prominence random circuitous A former junior college basketball player Christianrockband frontman wandered politics running conservative website became megaphone Mike Hubbard rapacious corrupt speaker House Representatives Simss home state Alabama This turn led Trump campaign led White House worked January 2017 May 2018 communication aide
Sims admirer Trump remains sympathetic though fashion cleareyed president But butted head number White House colleague including John Kelly chief staff ultimately blocked advancement In one memorable dustup Kelly Sims argued whether Sims permission get Trump sign football already autographed University Alabamas national championship team Sims hoped give Alabamas governor When Sims decided wanted write book chose Latimer Urbahn agent part told working White House saw firsthand whoever press comms Comey book good
We coffee Washingtons fancy new Wharf development near Sims recently moved apartment wife After week saturationlevel appearance cable news book rollout attained Beltwayspecific form celebrity Strangers approached Acela selfies He getting ready hit road number corporate speaking gig experience Trump Some people want entertaining story like work Sims said Others wanted substantive talk negotiates approach interaction foreign country help give window think people around
Sims initially hoped write selfhelp book entrepreneur along line The 21 Irrefutable Laws Leadership pastor motivational speaker John Maxwell But Latimer Urbahn prodded toward memoir They encouraged write would write werent afraid Sims said They encouraged honest And I think thats book kind stood marketplace The Spicer book I guess example book people didnt find credible
Sims referring Sean Spicer Simss old White House bos cautionary tale Early short tenure Trumps press secretary Spicer contacted Latimer Urbahn knew Spicer day Republican National Committee spokesman help plotting escape Matts advice Look youve got leave term Urbahn said If think time go havent pulled cord yet late
The agent laid careful exit strategy Spicer began resignation medium blackout eventually memoir overly critical Trump acknowledged president Spicers shortcoming finally new career pundit Karl Rove model Urbahn explained When Spicer announced resignation July 21 2017 Latimer Urbahn assumed plan motion
Then saw news Twitter Spicer would appearing Sean Hannitys Fox News show night Urbahn called Spicer immediately I said I saw youre going go Hannity tonight Youre literally going cost seven figure Youre going telegraph world everything copacetic Trump youre going biggest fan outside Its want told u game plan go contributor television
Spicer went Hannity anyway Latimer Urbahn eventually gave He hired Barnett get TV contract superlawyer couldnt deliver Using different agent Spicer wound getting publishing deal Trump memoir The Briefing one would mistaken tellall sell well Last month became special correspondent entertainment news show Extra In debut quizzed Secretary State Mike Pompeo music listens
Things went similarly sideways Omarosa Manigault Newman erstwhile Apprentice star former White House aide In early 2018 Latimer Urbahn negotiated substantial contract Hachette book would offer extremely critical take Trump But several week agreement hand Manigault Newman without informing Hachette appeared CBS reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother offered disparaging remark Trump thereby undercutting surprise book Hachette backed deal
Represented different agent Manigault Newman later signed book deal Simon Schuster CBS subsidiary After Sims signed book deal Manigault Newman sent brief congratulatory text Juicy She Spicer failed understand Latimer told key getting Trump World view mystery
Of course make successful tellall book mystery also revelation contains alarming better The specter ballooning deficit counted alarming Stockmans day seems quaint compared Comeys fear Trump colluded foreign adversary obstructed justice Indeed stake attached charge made Trump tellalls high fair ask charge delivered book In past insider perceived secret sort stake whether straightarrow administration official like John Dean canny bureaucratic operator like Mark Felt rogue whistleblower like Daniel Ellsberg Edward Snowden couch least first bid bestseller list Would dire warning Comey successor Andrew McCabe whose book The Threat How FBI Protects America Age Terror Trump published February carry weight author werent receiving million
Thats reasonable question Comey conceded In case I would suggest I offered free public testimony June 8 2017 That Comey appeared Senate Intelligence Committee revealed among thing Trump directed stop investigating former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn That essence story Comey continued rest Im trying offer broader well beyond Trump lesson leader
I posed question Urbahn Books still cultural weight people treat differently opeds congressional testimony said This part American experience people since Grant Ulysses S Grant course wrote memoir dying throat cancer desperate losing money Ponzi scheme leave inheritance wife child In process produced one great autobiography American letter one still read century later Will said Trump author
Guy Snodgrass would like think One Latimer Urbahns newest client Snodgrass somewhat atypical Trump administration refugee He Navy pilot nearly two decade one time commanding FA18 squadron Japan went work communication director Defense Secretary James Mattis April 2017 Last August left Pentagon retired Navy long reached Latimer Urbahn
Snodgrass told wanted meet two agent interested writing book time Pentagon Mattis order highlight professionalism Defense Department colleague give future military officer understanding really like work level He envisioned book might one day taught Naval Academy alma mater
Latimer Urbahn told interested meeting Snodgrass wanted hear inside dope might able share He story like inside inner circle crazy frenetic pace traveling around world hardcharging secretary defense Urbahn recalled There also number interaction Donald Trump uh Urbahn paused began chuckle interesting They agreed take Snodgrass client helped write proposal December got sixfigure book deal Penguin imprint The book scheduled published fall
On recent morning Snodgrass sitting Javelins conference room He finished first draft ready Latimer Urbahn give note Wearing windbreaker bore insignia Navys elite Top Gun pilot school served instructor Snodgrass templed finger listened agent critique
They told needed make chapter le chronological thematic They pressed draw fuller portrait Mattis go greater detail seen experienced especially came Mattiss interaction Trump
It memoir reminded policy book I think entire value proposition book talked beginning Urbahn explained here sort cornfed allAmerican guy who going tell like inside room Trump Mattis
Snodgrass seemed bit uncomfortable He worried going detail revealing everything proximity power enabled witness old Navy colleague might accuse selling Im coming slightly different angle Snodgrass told agent My entire adult life serving uniform always service self dont selfaggrandize
A central argument Snodgrasss book Mattis first year Pentagon able tame Trumps damaging instinct convincing president policy Mattis military brass preferred area like NATO Afghanistan fact one Trump wanted Now Latimer Urbahn trying perform similar move Snodgrass
The way inoculate charge selfaggrandizement really good argument youre book Latimer told Snodgrass And purpose said opportunity observe significant thing happened history turbulent time unprecedented time Pentagon there lesson warning want offer people danger ahead risk ahead That make important people know saw
Snodgrass nodded agreement Their logic strong
Three potential book cover publisher designed displayed TV screen Latimer Urbahn Snodgrass agreed title Holding Line perfect none liked subtitle Inside Pentagon With General Mattis Its got something Trump Latimer said commercial purpose
The cover Latimer Urbahn liked featured photograph Mattis sitting next Trump cabinet meeting Trump somewhat blurry foreground speaking Mattis sharp focus regarded president mute stoicism That photo entire book Latimer exclaimed It really It agent could already envision angry presidential tweet cover might provoke book sale tweet would drive
A picture worth thousand word Latimer told Snodgrass In case hundred thousand word

Part 1 Imperial Reach Murdoch child toppled government two continent destabilized important democracy Earth What want
By JONATHAN MAHLER JIM RUTENBERG APRIL 3 2019
Rupert Murdoch lying floor cabin unable move It January 2018 Murdoch fourth wife Jerry Hall spending holiday cruising Caribbean elder son Lachlans yacht Lachlan personally overseen design 140foot sloop named Sarissa long especially dangerous spear used army ancient Macedonia ensuring would suitable family vacation also remaining competitive superyacht regatta The cockpit could transformed swimming pool The ceiling childrens cabin became illuminated facsimile nighttime sky separate switch Northern Southern Hemispheres A detachable board practicing rock climbing passion Lachlans could set deck But easiest environment 86yearold man negotiate Murdoch tripped way bathroom middle night
Murdoch fallen couple time recent year stair exiting stage another time carpet San Francisco hotel The family prevented word getting occasion incident concerning This one seemed far serious Murdoch stretchered Sarissa flown hospital Los Angeles The doctor quickly spotted broken vertebra required immediate surgery well spinal hematoma increasing risk paralysis even death Hall called adult child panic urging come California prepared make peace father
Few private citizen ever central state world affair man lying hospital bed awaiting childrens arrival As head sprawling global medium empire commanded multiple television network global news service major publishing house Hollywood movie studio His newspaper television network instrumental amplifying nativist revolt reshaping government United States also across planet His 24hour newsandopinion network Fox News Channel fused President Trump base hardcore supporter giving Murdoch unparalleled degree influence world powerful democracy In Britain Londonbased tabloid The Sun recently led historic Brexit crusade drive country European Union chaos ensued helped deliver Theresa May 10 Downing Street In Australia Murdochs power undiluted outlet led effort repeal country carbon tax first nation pushed series prime minister whose agenda didnt comport And midst biggest deal life Only week fall Lachlans yacht shook hand London rooftop Robert A Iger chief executive Walt Disney Company consummating preliminary agreement sell TV film studio 21st Century Fox Disney 524 billion But control sprawling empire suddenly air
The four grown child differing claim throne The 61yearold Prudence child Murdochs first marriage Australian model Patricia Booker divorced 1965 lived Sydney London kept distance family business But three child Murdochs second marriage Anna Mann divorced 1999 spent least part life jockeying succeed father Elisabeth 50 Lachlan 47 James 46 grew business As child sat around family breakfast table Fifth Avenue listening father tutorial morning paper article selected laid many ad page All imagined evergrowing company might one day belong As friend Murdochs liked say Murdoch didnt raise child raised future medium mogul
It made fraught family dynamic competing ambition evershifting alliance Murdoch largely responsible state affair He long avoided naming one child successor deferring announcement might create still friction within family mention bringing focus mortality Instead Murdoch tried manage tension arranging group therapy child spouse counselor London specialized working dynastic family There even therapeutic retreat Murdoch ranch Australia But session provided another forum power game manipulation
Read 6 takeaway story
Over year Lachlan James traded role heir apparent jilted son It secret close family Murdoch always favored Lachlan But I love child Murdoch would say people close pointed clear preference Lachlan But James spent first decade 21st century helping reposition company digital future exploiting new market around world expanding online offering embracing broadband streaming technology older brother mostly running business Australia bitter split father When Lachlan finally agreed return United States 2015 Murdoch gave James dueling senior title All company division would report jointly It awkward arrangement putatively charge single empire James Lachlan different people different politics pushing company toward different future James toward globalized multiplatform newsandentertainment brand would seem sensible attendee Davos reader The Economist Lachlan toward something past increasingly moment unabashedly nationalist farright hugely profitable political propaganda machine
Only one Murdochs adult child would win ultimate prize running world powerful medium empire four would ultimately equal say direction future Murdoch structured company 21st Century Fox News Corp Murdoch Family Trust held controlling interest He held four trust eight vote adult child one He could never outvoted But also stipulated gone vote would disappear decisionmaking power would revert child This meant death could set power struggle would dwarf anything family seen alive possibly reorder political landscape across Englishspeaking world
As child hurried father bedside Los Angeles seemed moment finally arrived
Media power historically accrued slowly course generation one reason tends concentrated dynastic family The Graham family owned The Washington Post 80 year selling Amazons founder Jeff Bezos William R Hearst III still presides Hearst Corporation whose root traced greatgrandfather miningbaronturnedUnitedStatessenator George Hearst The New York Times controlled OchsSulzberger family century The Murdoch empire relatively young one comparison would hard argue powerful medium family earth
The rightwing populist wave looked like fleeting cultural phenomenon year ago turned defining political movement time disrupting world order last halfcentury The Murdoch empire cause wave But single medium company enabled promoted profited Across Englishspeaking world family outlet helped elevate marginal demagogue mainstream ethnonationalism politicize notion truth The result striking It may family mission destabilize democracy around world consequential legacy
Over last six month spoken 150 people across three continent Murdochs empire know family intimately helped achieve aim fought varying degree success Most people insisted anonymity share intimate detail family business risk retribution The medium tend pay lot attention medium Fox News covered almost closely White House often story The Murdochs enduring object cultural fascination Ink play Ruperts rise opening soon Broadway The second season HBOs Succession whose fictional medium family Roys bear striking resemblance Murdochs air summer But reporter fully appreciated extent two story one illiberal rightwing reaction sweeping globe dynastic medium family really one To see Fox News arm Trump White House risk missing larger picture It may accurate say White House like prime minister office Britain Australia one tool among many family us exert influence world event
What Murdochs want Family dynamic complex medium dynasty animated different factor workaday business imperative desire pas wealth oldfashioned sense civic duty But Murdochs global operation suggest different dynastic orientation one centered empire building original sense term territorial conquest Murdoch began small regional paper Australia inherited father He quickly expanded business national international force part ruthlessly using platform help elect preferred candidate ruthlessly using candidate help extend reach Murdochs news empire monument decade worth transactional relationship elected official Murdoch said never asked prime minister anything But press baron dont ask medium outlet broadcast desire Politicians know Murdoch want know deliver base voter power
The Murdoch approach empire building reached apotheosis Trump era Murdoch long dreamed close relationship American president On surface Trump little common One global citizen home around world voracious reader least sense selfawareness Murdoch photographed last year beach reading Utopia Realists Rutger Bregman Dutch historian later told Tucker Carlson interview Carlson millionaire funded billionaire The proudly crass American vacation country club dines fast food watch lot TV But son aspiring empire builder respective dynasty shared core value growth territorial conquest employed method achieve leveraging political relationship gain power influence In Trumps case relationship helped secure zoning exemption tax abatement global licensing deal Murdochs case allowed influence evade antimonopoly foreignownership rule
Murdoch carefully built image six decade medium pragmatist support liberal government suit Yet various news outlet inexorably pushed flow history right across Anglosphere whether advocating United States ally go war Iraq 2003 undermining global effort combat climate change vilifying people color home abroad dangerous threat white majority
Even empire grew traversing ocean country medium Murdoch saw would always remain family business Underpinning worldview government enemy independent medium business model depended nonetheless government intervention advance interest undermine competitor The Murdoch dynasty draw line among politics money power work together seamlessly service overarching goal imperial expansion
It would impossible empire sprawling Murdochs completely culturally ideologically consistent He businessman want satisfy customer His asset also include entertainment company sport network moderate broadsheet Murdoch embodies contradiction Hes immigrant stoking nationalism billionaire championing populism father never saw reason keep family separate business fact deliberately merged two
Most dynasty break apart eventually decisionmaking power dispersed across individual generation different attitude family business world general No one know better Murdoch 2007 took Dow Jones publisher The Wall Street Journal exploiting division within Bancroft family run paper century Murdoch thought protected similar fate keeping controlling interest empire one could take away
The challenge would holding together
To understand Murdoch empire work essential return origin On day 1931 Rupert Murdoch born father Keith Murdoch midst first campaign elect prime minister newsroom Australia As young newspaperman Keith gained fame evading military censor report slaughter countryman Britishled Gallipoli campaign World War I He leveraged fame become powerful executive Melbourne Herald Weekly Times news company position turn leveraged punish enemy reward ally The candidate supporting prime minister Joseph Lyons earlier helped Keith overcome regulatory restriction start radio station company Adelaide according historian Tom Robertss 2015 biography Murdochs father Before Rupert Lyons Keith saw Australias new leader served pleasure I put reportedly said two later squabbled And Ill put
As Keith creating one country first national news chain regional Australian newspaper editorialized danger ambition warning Roberts wrote creating press dictatorship Australia Murdochinspired leader Murdochtrained reporter Bound Keiths business interest ideological inclination power work also allowed exercise He member Eugenics Society Victoria editorial wrote great question facing Britain need fight White Australia
Keith never built true medium empire He two regional newspaper one sold pay death duty died suddenly 1952 That left 75000circulation News Adelaide 21yearold son finishing degree Oxford But Rupert Murdoch already received something much valuable father extended tutorial use medium holding extract favor politician
His first order business establish proper Murdochowned empire Australia After buying couple additional local paper founded country first national generalinterest newspaper The Australian gave powerful platform help elect government eased national regulation designed limit size medium company He would eventually take control nearly twothirds national newspaper market With construction Australian medium empire underway Murdoch moved Britain Fleet Street using newest acquisition The News World The Sun successfully promote Margaret Thatchers candidacy prime minister Once elected government declined refer acquisition The Times London antimonopoly regulator giving country leading establishment broadsheet go masscirculation tabloid
Television next After Murdoch lost bidding British government sole satellite broadcasting license Thatcher came rescue looking way started rival service Sky Television beamed programming Britain Luxembourg The bigger Murdochs empire became power clear away obstacle expansion His influence became uncomfortable fact British political life Murdoch seemed revel Its The Sun Wot Won It The Sun declared front page 1992 helping send Tory leader John Major 10 Downing Street relentlessly smearing character opponent Neil Kinnock Nightmare Kinnock Street The Sun headlined savage ninepage package included satirical endorsement ghost Joseph Stalin Murdoch could switch party suited purpose ably supported Britains New Labor movement 1990s Conservatives time proposed regulation would forced scale back newspaper operation order expand TV
Murdoch used playbook United States In 1980 met Roy Cohn former adviser Senator Joseph McCarthy Trump mentor introduced Gov Ronald Reagans inner circle It group included Roger Stone Jr another Trump confidant head Reagans New York operation said later interview helped Murdoch weaponize latest tabloid purchase The New York Post Reagans behalf 1980 election Reagans team credited Murdoch delivering state year Murdoch gave Stone Election Day printing plate The Post celebratory meal 21 Club administration subsequently facilitated Murdochs entry American television market quickly approving application American citizenship could buy TV station
The Reagan administration later waived prohibition owning television station newspaper market allowing Murdoch hold onto big metro daily The New York Post The Boston Herald even moved TV city The administration George HW Bush suspended rule forbade broadcast network primetime show profit That move allowed Murdoch build nation fourth broadcast network rapidly filling schedule show newly acquired 20th Century Fox studio The Simpsons 21 Jump Street also earning substantial profit production unit syndicated rerun hit like MASH LA Law
Maybe medium mogul generation Murdoch exploited seismic change transforming industry waning year 20th century another lesson Keith early adopter radio newsreel These change driven technology It possible transmit endless amount content world instant But also driven regulatory change particular liberation TV radio operator government guideline ruled public airwave The Reagan administration elimination Fairness Doctrine decade required broadcaster present side major publicpolicy debate spawned new generation rightwing radio personality free provide different sort opinion programming large latent conservative audience mistrustful medium general It matter time similar programming started migrating burgeoning medium 24houraday cable television And course Murdoch imported
Murdoch watched enviously younger rival Ted Turner built cable news network CNN In 1996 Roger Ailes former medium adviser Nixon George HW Bush started conservative competitor Fox News catered Americans whose political preference gone unaddressed television news Another political favor crucial When Time Warner owned CNN refused carry new network cable system New York city Republican mayor Rudolph W Giuliani another future Trump adviser lion page The Post publicly pressured cable company two side moved toward eventual deal
A roundtheclock network virtual monopoly conservative TV news Fox conferred Murdoch whole new sort influence enhanced politically polarizing event like Monica Lewinsky scandal postSept 11 war Iraq marked early year If Murdochs paper blunt instrument Foxs influence way subtle also far profound Hour hour day day shaping reality million Americans treated primary news source A 2007 study found introduction network particular cable system pushed local voter right Fox News Effect became known In 2014 Pew Research poll majority selfdescribed conservative said news network trusted Murdochs office Fox newsroom Midtown Manhattan became requisite stop serious Republican presidential candidate schedule
Fifty year untold number deal taking possession The News Adelaide Murdoch arrived pinnacle global influence Republicans originally thought Fox worked u David Frum former speechwriter George W Bush said interview Nightline And discovering work Fox
Murdochs success building empire inevitably raised question would rule gone As grew older would often say privately didnt want become another Sumner Redstone aging medium mogul refused cede control CBS Viacom even losing ability speak eat unassisted But turned 75 80 Murdoch declined lay plan future empire
Initially favored Lachlan installing general manager one Australian newspaper chain age 22 overseeing rise post deputy chief operating officer News Corp age 33 But Lachlans rise cut short clashed repeatedly seasoned executive viewed entitled princeling Furious father siding dispute Lachlan left company United States 2005 returning Murdochs ancestral homeland 100 million payout family trust James chief executive British Sky Broadcasting formerly Sky Television later shortened Sky took mantle heir apparent
But summer 2015 Murdoch 84 changed mind James Lachlan next line The news delivered James father Lachlan company president Chase Carey lunch Manhattan Lachlan moving back United States take business James would report
James livid The two brother father explicitly discussed succession even two year earlier James supposed take Lachlan would never assume symbolic role As James saw promised job earned He devoted year life trying build company moving family Hong Kong London making monthly trip Mumbai push family satelliteTV business emerging technology new market brother Australia spearfishing making dubious investment Angry appalled James threatened quit heading straight lunch airport flight Indonesia
With clipped nearBritish accent penchant wearing bluejeans espadrille James read archetype today global power elite Years ago family rebel piercing ear dyeing hair light bulb tattooed right arm As undergraduate Harvard James flirted becoming medieval historian joined staff The Harvard Lampoon dropping 1995 follow Grateful Dead start independent hiphop label Rawkus Records whose artist included Talib Kweli Mos Def A year later father bought Rawkus brought James News Corp ending shortlived foray outside family business In 2000 James married Kathryn Hufschmid fashionmarketing executive parttime model Oregon met mutual friend yacht bound Fiji whose liberal politics made outlier Murdoch family She argued frequently fatherinlaw Foxs politics The constant sparring grew tiresome Murdoch worried Kathryn much influence younger son He would often suggest James two go dinner alone needed discus something according person close Murdoch
Even inside father empire James continued view idealistic term one best suited drag sprawling often backwardthinking company future whether meant making office carbonneutral leading investment digitally oriented business like Hulu moderating wilder impulse Fox News A selfdescribed political centrist James saw network one biggest obstacle effort diversify expand company In meeting senior executive one attendee recalled said wanted change image Murdoch empire longer viewed company defined single product charismatic founder
Lachlan identified closely charismatic founder His trajectory different Jamess He shared father attachment Australia family long history inside country hypermasculine roughhewed culture When younger worked jackeroo herding vaccinating sheep lamb rural Australia culled kangaroo family ranch Cavan shotgun His father stuck clay pigeon After graduating Princeton Lachlan returned Australia work family business becoming instant celebrity known wearing outback boot suit riding Kawasaki motorcycle work showing armband tattoo rock climbing courting Australian model Sarah OHare married 1999
Lachlan doesnt speak publicly politics employee Australia found took hard line many issue Chris Mitchell longtime editor The Australian recalled 2016 memoir Making Headlines Lachlans conservatism vigorous Australian politician view usually right father Lachlan presented one family paper express displeasure decision run editorial support samesex marriage according three people knew interaction time Lachlan said representative recollection incident support samesex marriage According people close Lachlan question see exorbitant cost addressing climate change belief debate global warming getting much attention
Lachlan viewed brother good executive felt one taken risk proved Australia It true investment failed hed bought TV network Ten went receivership losing 232 million six month others including group Top100 easylistening radio station earning ten million dollar year
Murdoch trying year coax Lachlan back Australia Murdochs 2013 divorce third wife Wendi Murdoch helped change Lachlans mind He James tried talk father marrying Wendi 1999 dinner Manhattan restaurant Babbo rare subject two son agreed grown even le fond year followed James least one company executive heard senior foreign official believed Chinese intelligence asset And family member felt treated father terribly calling old stupid A spokesman Wendi Murdoch denied claim
Apart Wendi son odds almost everything They fighting control father empire fighting one home 8651squarefoot Spanishstyle mansion Beverly Hills Murdoch bought house furnished 1980s music mogul Jules Stein son sentimental attachment spent lot time child According six people close family James Lachlan upset learn father put house market 35 million offer Leonardo DiCaprio The brother briefly discussed buying house together whoever happened LA given moment could use James finally agreed buy house discounted price 30 million though Kathryn learned needed four new retaining wall costing million dollar Lachlan upset brother gotten house As gift Murdoch gave antique furniture inside even though James Kathryn thought bought furnished
While James overseas ready quit father brother came compromise All 21st Century Foxs division would report James would chief executive Lachlan would share exalted title cochairman father The announcement would carefully worded suggest coequals protect James public humiliation even though Lachlan technically senior executive Their salary identical roughly 20 million year start Each would access corporate plane professional personal use James would based company corporate office Midtown Manhattan Lachlan side country vast chairman office formerly occupied father Building 88 21st Century Fox lot decorated picture Cavan ranch 1979 blackandwhite photograph Murdoch standing front New York Post printing press

Part 3 The New Fox Weapon The Disney deal left Murdochs medium empire stripped essence hardcore rightwing news machine Lachlan charge
By JONATHAN MAHLER JIM RUTENBERG APRIL 3 2019
This Part 3 threepart story Go back read Part 1 Part 2
It midst moment biggest deal career 86yearold Murdoch tripped way bathroom Lachlans yacht transported Los Angeles With father laid Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center start 2018 Murdochs child descended Los Angeles unsure would end Lachlan wife Sarah met hospital Elisabeth husband Keith Tyson came London James Kathryn New York Murdochs surgery successful Not long child arrived condition stabilized Following neardeath experience Murdoch joked realize serious condition seen child gathered around hospital bed
Murdoch would laid next month still command running thing bedroom Moraga In email senior management leaked Vanity Fairs Gabriel Sherman described incident sailing accident said would working home little In meantime Murdoch wrote youll hearing email phone text
The negotiation continued As Lachlan James adjusted new reality Unable secure job Disney wanted wary aggressively safe hierarchical culture James decided winter would try follow family asset new home according three people close Lachlan would take left Murdoch empire without interference brother
In early June 2018 final term settled another bidder emerged Brian Roberts chief executive Comcast offered Murdoch 65 billion 21st Century Fox 126 billion Disney prepared pay Murdoch didnt want sell Comcast according three people familiar thinking He preferred Disney variety reason including personal admiration Iger viewed risktaking leader image Whats Comcast offer cash would create big tax burden Murdoch But Murdoch like prospect bidding war And potential path securing higher price preferred buyer Justice Departments ongoing lawsuit block proposed merger ATT Time Warner
Comcasts interest 21st Century Fox allowed Murdoch drive Disneys purchase price 713 billion Iger team delivered hoped would final offer personally Murdoch London traveling Ireland worried Comcast might tracking movement private plane flying London United States Murdoch Disney hook
His back healed Murdoch attended Allen Company medium conference Sun Valley Idaho July 2018 With Roberts Iger nearby seemed exhilarated middle action The problem Murdoch Comcast made another counteroffer might fiduciary responsibility present offer board might accept absent extenuating circumstance He didnt want stalking horse overtake favorite
Read 6 takeaway story
The Trump Justice Department came Murdochs rescue appealing federal court ruling ATT Time Warner case On face lawsuit nothing Comcast company history tangle government regulator appeal would give Murdoch cover needed accept Igers latest bid Comcast looked risky There evidence Justice Department factored Murdochs interest decisionmaking process nevertheless gotten another 20 billion company still selling preferred suitor
When deal finalized Murdoch would personally make roughly 4 billion bringing net worth 18 billion All six child would receive 2 billion Lachlan James would get even additional 20 million Disney stock plus golden parachute worth 70 million Yet neither one getting really wanted
Media empire built foresight audacity leader ability anticipate embrace sudden change industry thats constantly evolving But also built something far mundane government regulation More anything moving line lifting cap rewriting rule enable mogul transform business empire These decision invariably opaque product labyrinthine bureaucratic process inherently subjective definition whats public interest Under President Trump decision almost always broken Murdochs way
The Time WarnerATT deal good example ambiguity bureaucratic process It worked perfectly Murdoch Trump reason try block acquisition Time Warner owner CNN constantly feuding He called deal thats good country privately urged chief economics adviser Gary Cohn stop according two people told conversation The exchange first reported The New Yorker Deals like vertical merger two company separate business rarely face antitrust scrutiny And yet Trumps Department Justice sued prevent first time federal government taken step 40 year The Justice Department antitrust enforcer filed government lawsuit deal Makan Delrahim fact record saying earlier didnt see major antitrust problem And yet federal judge Richard Leon dismissed Justice Departments case calling one key argument gossamer thin government appealed time stave Comcasts next bid 21st Century Fox The process dragged two year
The speed Murdochs Disney deal approved stood stark contrast This type agreement horizontal merger bringing together Hollywoods largest thirdlargest studio would give combined company nearmonopoly power raise consumer price limit choice Such deal ordinarily invite strict government scrutiny The Department Justice approved six month Fox executive credit company thorough preparation speedy successful review After calling Murdoch ensure deal wouldnt affect Fox News Trump applauded This could great thing job press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said asked characterize president reaction agreement Wall Street analyst predicted deal would result thousand layoff
The ambiguity regulatory process also evident another deal major implication Murdochs empire In spring 2017 month Murdoch started negotiating Iger Sinclair Broadcast Group agreed buy Tribune Media 39 billion Sinclair already largest owner local TV station country It also overwhelmingly proTrump Its local station many key swing state provided Trump positive coverage campaign result part deal Kushner personally struck Sinclairs chairman David Smith Murdoch concerned company steady growth With Sinclairs acquisition Tribune already 39 percent American household company would 70 percent Whats Tribune owned WGN unremarkable cable channel unexploited potential It reached nearly 80 million home could easily converted rightwing national news network instant competitor Fox News In conversation colleague Murdoch worried Sinclair might hire OReilly marquee star new Fox rival
Sinclair seemed friend ally Trump also Federal Communications Commissions chairman Ajit Pai Days election still commissioner agency appeared Sinclair executive retreat Four Seasons Baltimore according Politico story After became chairman 2017 effectively enabled Sinclairs bid Tribune station easing limit many station single company could There enough suspicion Pai might inclined give Sinclair favorable treatment FCCs inspector general started investigation commissioner relationship company But summer 2018 Pai basically blocked deal announcing serious concern Sinclair official said shocked
Once thing broken Murdochs way The report cleared Pai inappropriate conduct either help hurt Sinclair though left question unanswered Fox like Pai Jared Kushner discussed conversation deal announced Pai asked anyone Fox News tried influence ruling He responded negative investigator wrote
In middle August 2018 Lachlan Murdoch emerged Gulfstream G550 Tshirt jean climbed black Range Rover waiting tarmac Australian paparazzo waiting often Lachlan father arrived Sydney This time town Murdoch landed two day earlier They went company award dinner another agenda well
The night arrival Lachlan invited small group Sky employee manager 16 million mansion Sydney drink With new primetime lineup hardright opinion host Sky become force Australian politics Its audience still small American standard network choice capital Canberra finalizing deal expand reach Australian Outback demographically speaking equivalent Trump country
It mirror Fox News fixation race identity climatechange denial Night night Skys host guest stirred anger perceived liberal bias medium suicidal selfhatred Western civilization Australian equivalent Central American caravan dividing United States asylum seeker coming country boat Indonesia Malaysia many Muslim Days Lachlans arrival national neoNazi leader Blair Cottrell recently fined inciting contempt Muslims appeared one network show Cottrell interviewed Australian TV deferential treatment Sky caused national outcry Under gentle questioning called countryman reclaim traditional identity Australians advocated limiting immigration culturally dissimilar u white South African farmer Sky apologized suspended program
Inside Lachlans living room talk turned national politics Do think Malcolm going survive Lachlan asked staff Malcolm Malcolm Turnbull relatively moderate Australian prime minister took office year earlier Inside government small rightwing uprising brewing plan bring Australia compliance Paris climate accord It well established among worked Murdochs family rarely ever issue specific directive They convey desire indirectly maybe tweet Murdoch spring 2016 decided back Trump question subtlety rarely lost likeminded news executive
In day followed Sky Australias host Murdoch paper newspaper editor drink session Lachlans mansion set trying throw Turnbull office Alan Jones Sky host conservative radio star called party rebellion program Days later Murdochs major paper Sydney The Daily Telegraph broke news leadership challenge work Cheering challenge Andrew Bolt Murdoch columnist convicted violating country Racial Discrimination Act told Sky viewer Turnbulls credibility shot authority gone Peta Credlin commentator Tony Abbotts former chief staff chewed member Parliament chaos inside Turnbulls administration The Australian Murdochs national newspaper soon declaring Turnbull dead man walking
Word got back Turnbull Lachlans remark staff He knew Sky After Dark becoming increasingly critical Months earlier aide showed video montage promotional clip network questioning leadership country Is always like aide recalled asking But believed tough coverage part concerted campaign One senior aide confronted Murdochs Australian executive text shared u The Turnbull camp knew said Lachlan made clear editor drink Tuesday night would like MT get rolled
Turnbull heard Rupert Murdoch miffed reached since landed country according three former official Turnbulls government Turnbulls chief staff trying set meeting Murdoch redoubled effort Turnbull settled phone call pleading Murdoch back Let look let talk Lachlan Murdoch said Im retired Ill talk Lachlan Through spokesman Murdoch denied felt slighted Turnbull
Two day later Turnbulls rightwing opponent ousted definitive intraparty vote known Australian politics leadership spill Chaos ensued creating roundtheclock political theater Sky Australia logged highest rating network history The Murdochs denied role ouster
It always difficult separate personal financial ideological Murdochs All appeared evidence decision turn Turnbull To begin took office year earlier ousting Lachlans friend Tony Abbott Abbott helped lead Turnbull uprising Turnbulls policy also perfectly aligned Murdochs interest For instance expedited construction country national broadband network directly threatened family highly profitable cable business giving Netflix governmentsubsidized pipeline Australian home
The small number Australian medium outlet Murdochs portrayed Turnbulls ouster Murdochled coup Kevin Rudd former prime minister family helped push office year earlier described Murdoch oped The Sydney Morning Herald greatest cancer Australian democracy
Turnbull replaced rightwing nationalist Scott Morrison quickly aligned Trump The two met person first time late 2018 G20 summit meeting Buenos Aires I think going great relationship Trump said afterward With national election scheduled May 2019 Morrison quickly staked party prospect polarizing issue immigration promising new hardline approach It dovetailed Skys regular primetime programming Andrew Bolt previously warned foreign invasion said one segment We also risk importing ethnic religious strife even terrorism screen flashed image Australias potential future row Muslims city street bowing toward Mecca When opposing Labor Party managed muscle legislation would allow doctor transfer severely sick migrant detention center island Nauru Manus hospital Australia Sky Australias primetime host went offensive
The third generation Murdoch dynasty finally taking control The Disney deal still pending regulatory approval country two company overlapping operation China Mexico Brazil elsewhere Lachlan already shifting new role chairman chief executive new Fox The empire much smaller political term least le powerful direction clear
Lachlan generally avoids ontherecord interview taking ownership family business seemed appropriate make least one public appearance He chose New York Timessponsored DealBook conference corporate leadership On Nov 1 le three month Australian coup Lachlan appeared onstage Time Warner Center Midtown Manhattan Tieless white shirt navy suit trademark black outback boot offered selfless account Disney deal We immediately saw made great deal strategic sense told interviewer New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin He asked Murdoch part disappointed prospect shrinking wouldbe empire Your first thought shareholder Lachlan replied During brief Q A followed Lachlan dismissed critic Fox News narrowminded No Im embarrassed said network primetime host I frankly feel country tolerant others view
In day leading conference Fox News host guest moving ever closer openly embracing bigoted sentiment whitenationalist movement A day antiSemitic attack Pittsburgh synagogue killed 11 Jewish worshiper guest Lou Dobbss show said migrant caravan headed United States border Honduras funded Sorosoccupied State Department The network apologized The shooter according post made social medium come believe Jews transporting member migrant caravan When Tucker Carlson came fire increasingly pointed attack immigration We moral obligation admit world poor tell u even make country poorer dirtier divided received personal text message support Lachlan according two people familiar text
The line Fox News Trump White House continuing blur At Hannitys urging Trump hired unemployed Bill Shine deputy chief staff communication summer 2018 ushering new era increased hostility White House mainstream medium Within day arrival Washington July 2018 Shine called Fox control room change onscreen chyron Ivanka Trump considered unflattering according source inside Fox say request denied Shine also barred Kaitlan Collins CNN White House reporter event asked Trump several question Michael Cohen President Vladimir Putin Russia
Unlike father Lachlan longterm relationship Trump hired former White House communication director Hope Hicks new chief communication officer new Fox Hicks 29 rare member Trumps inner circle left administration good term remained close president Trump family others White House Kushner privately told people provided reference Murdoch
Lachlans first initiative Fox Nation subscriptiononly ondemand streaming service started last fall Fox superfans It would platform new generation Fox star viewer One prominent personality Tomi Lahren 26yearold recent graduate University Nevada Las Vegas built large socialmedia following bitesize quip instance referred Black Lives Matter new KKK refugee rapeugees Most show would livestreamed day making convenient alternative network daytime news programming politically neutral many Fox watcher And Fox Nation internet content could even le restrained network evening programming In addition opinionheavy political coverage would also lighter fare cooking show Fox Friends host Steve Doocy deep dive including documentary former anchor CBS Evening News Black Eye Dan Rather Birth Fake News Lachlans longerterm plan take undiluted unchecked form Fox News overseas
Roger Ailes blocked Sean Hannity hosting Tea Party fundraiser show When Hannity Fox host Jeanine Pirro joined Trump onstage final rally November midterm election old Ailesian concern network keep least distance political ally come feel quaint Hannity played crowd referring reporter press pen fake news praising Trumps accomplishment After tepid rebuke management participating rally clarified comment press They intended refer Foxs reporter rally said rest medium
At time Fox News seemed dictating presidential policy least channeling base appeared control White Houses agenda In late 2018 Trump heading toward budget deal newly ascendant Democrats guest host across network started shaming demanding sign government spending bill didnt include 5 billion border wall Dont listen squish adviser urged Pete Hegseth Fox Friends host He didnt He listened Fox instead shut federal government It madeforTV climax campaign started month earlier And like enduring paralysis British government political upheaval Australia legacy single family descending chaos
Having spent almost entire adult life trying prove worthy running Murdoch empire James finally broken He struck end 2018 setting family office new building Greenwich Village manage vastly expanded fortune invest technology startup By brother barely speaking term
James always accepted given interlacing politics business built family fortune He even practiced version however unsuccessfully London He stayed company two decade prove father dynastic obligation I cant leave told friend hacking scandal I brought The bond emotional His fortune tied holding family business In end father chosen Lachlan The empire James long sought run dismantled Lachlan lifelong competition become father heir really To friend James dismissed brother new company American political project
But even James couldnt fully distance new company He still holding large chunk voting stock long case fortune would tied Lachlans American political project He couldnt cash Murdoch made sure none child would able sell voting share outsider And yet lever influence company share virtually useless father remained controlling shareholder family trust James saw one solution He would sell stock Lachlan father maybe sister would join What complex family dynasty would become simple hereditary monarchy Elisabeth Prudence enthusiastically agreed Murdoch excited idea seeing opportunity rid company inhouse critic He urged Lachlan The two father son would company together The document drawn late 2018 given chance company Lachlan balked Through spokesman Lachlan said buying sibling wasnt financially feasible
Had Murdoch lost On one hand Murdoch achieved everything wanted He made child multibillionaires keeping division company dear also passing control favorite son Everyone Murdoch included thought Hillary Clinton going win 2016 made bet different candidate power countervailing historical force hed rewarded rating money access And yet bet torn apart family company What left sprawling medium empire contained ambition political weapon
James Kathryn planning devote fortune try neutralize weapon In early 2019 foundation Quadrivium announced initiative defend democratic nation saw rising threat illiberal populism bolster voting right
The Disney deal scheduled close spring During family final month owner storied 21st Century Fox attended Oscar festivity one last time It long annual event Murdochs earlier era family hosted event celebrityfilled party Beverly Hills home
There brief memorable exchange Vanity Fair dinner ceremony In one sense recapitulation ideological conflict dividing Murdochs world In another family spat When came Murdochs really difference
At Vanity Fair dinner ceremony Kathryn seated next Jon Lovett former speechwriter Barack Obama Hillary Clinton host vehemently antiTrump podcast Pod Save America Lovett seem thrilled table assignment Kathryn started talking quickly became clear share politics Murdoch family business The conversation inevitably turned Fox News damage Kathryn offered introduce Lovett chief executive network brotherinlaw seated table nearby Lovett initially resisted I dont need talk person Its going pleasant anyone later evening Kathryn brought together
Do feel proud whats happening 8 11 every night Lovett asked You think good world
Yeah I think theyre great job Lachlan replied Then Lachlan threw question back Lovett Were conservative voice would accept Fox Before Lovett could answer Kathryn interjected ticking list antiTrump Republicans
Lachlan turned away joined another conversation
On morning March 19 2019 new streamlined Fox officially became publicly traded Murdochcontrolled company Lachlan chairman chief executive Murdoch cochairman Its name simply Fox Corporation A week earlier Fox News held first upfront advertising agency trying reassure skittish ad buyer network represented safe brand product according report Ad Age There videotaped interview Fox News viewer deliver news accurately honestly panel discussion Fox personality expressed optimism state country network This great time American Laura Ingraham said Pretty much right I dont see get much better
In 22year history network Fox News Effect never pronounced A March study Navigation Research Democratic firm found 12 percent Fox News viewer believe climate change mostly caused human compared 62 percent Americans At time 78 percent Fox viewer believe Trump accomplished president American history compared 17 percent Americans
The could said global Murdoch effect Brexitinspired chaos continued rattle Britain Both Theresa Mays proposal formalize country break European Union rejected British Parliament The possibility nodeal Brexit country would simply crash European bloc quite possibly triggering historic economic collapse loomed In late March million protester took street London demand second Brexit referendum With Mays fellow conservative questioning continued leadership party former Murdoch columnist editor friend Michael Gove member Parliament talked possible replacement

WASHINGTON Its secret President Trump really really dislike wind power Hes vocal subject year ever since battle Scottish official plan build called really ugly wind farm within sight golf resort Aberdeen
More recently rally speech Mr Trump stepped attack wind turbine suggesting noise cause cancer there absolutely evidence predicting power failure wind stop blowing also true
Heres closer look recent comment
During sometimes rambling digression wind turbine National Republican Congressional Committees annual spring dinner Washington Tuesday Mr Trump said They say noise cause cancer
The suggestion turbine noise cause cancer completely unfounded The American Cancer Society unaware credible evidence linking noise windmill cancer spokeswoman group said email
Separately researcher investigating claim noise wind turbine might cause health problem like nausea headache sleeplessness So far expert havent found strong evidence link condition although debate likely persist
When compared research around coal power energy source Mr Trump long championed difference stark
There ample evidence linking particulate pollution coal plant heart disease respiratory problem lung cancer When Mr Trump moved relax restriction coal plant pollution last year Environmental Protection Agency estimated change could lead many 1400 additional premature death year 2030
Theres major shift America make electricity past two decade Each state story
At dinner Mr Trump made claim If windmill anywhere near house congratulation house went 75 percent value
There smaller study suggesting windfarm development may depressed property value area But balance evidence suggests uncommon Much larger study including analysis 50000 home sale across nine state conducted Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 2013 found evidence home value generally affected nearby wind project
In case Mr Trumps golf course Scotland appear suffered financially construction wind farm nearby
At rally Ohio last month Mr Trump suggested wind power unreliable useful Lets put windmill said When wind doesnt blow turn television darling please Theres wind Please turn television quickly
Its true wind turbine generate electricity wind blowing But doesnt mean power home suddenly go wind dy
Across United States regional grid operator typically rely diverse array power source throughout day light stay During sunny hour draw electricity solar panel When windy make use power wind farm If power renewable source start drop operator use power natural gas turbine hydroelectric dam fill gap
So far Americas grid operator good balancing act even coal declined renewables surged popularity Last year wind power accounted nearly onefifth electricity generated Texas grid people still able watch TV When power failure around country occur almost always severe weather knocking transmission line wind turbine stopped spinning
However also fair say wind solar power continue expand two source produced 82 percent nation electricity last year growing rapidly grid operator could face new challenge juggling intermittent source
Possible solution might include adding battery energy storage balance supply demand improving weather forecast operator better predict output wind farm Or building transmission line get access wind power distant region principle wind usually blowing somewhere country
Experts concluded technically possible United States manage lot wind solar power us today
For instance 2016 modeling study published Nature Climate Change found using existing technology country could get 55 percent electricity wind solar built network highvoltage transmission line That study analyzed ream historical weather data concluded light would stay even daily seasonal fluctuation wind
To sure plenty legitimate debate power grid future look like big role renewable energy ought play mix But fact wind come go hardly slamdunk argument using wind power

Trust pork producer fear wind turbine
By Paul Krugman
Opinion Columnist
Theres lot dont know legacy Donald Trump leave behind And course hugely important happens 2020 election But one thing seems sure Even he oneterm president Trump caused directly indirectly premature death large number Americans
Some death come hand rightwing white nationalist extremist rapidly growing threat partly feel empowered president call fine people
Some come failure governance like inadequate response Hurricane Maria surely contributed high death toll Puerto Rico Reminder Puerto Ricans US citizen
Some come administration continuing effort sabotage Obamacare failed kill health reform stalled decline number uninsured meaning many people still arent getting health care need Of course Trump get way eliminates Obamacare altogether thing front get much much worse
But biggest death toll likely come Trumps agenda deregulation maybe call deregulation administration curiously selective industry want leave alone
Consider two recent event help capture deadly strangeness whats going
One administration plan hog plant take much federal responsibility food safety inspection And Its weve seen safety problem arise selfregulation say aircraft industry Or ever experience major outbreak foodborne illness Or reason US government stepped regulate meatpacking first place
Now could see Trump administration willingness trust meat industry keep meat safe part overall attack government regulation willingness trust profitmaking business right thing let market rule And there something whole story illustrated another event Trumps declaration day wind turbine cause cancer
Now could put personal derangement Trump irrational hatred wind power ever since failed prevent construction wind farm near Scottish golf course And Trump seems deranged irrational many issue one bizarre claim hardly seems matter
But there another Trumpism After normally think Republicans general Trump particular people minimize deny negative externality imposed business activity uncompensated cost impose people business
For example Trump administration want roll back rule limit emission mercury power plant And pursuit goal want prevent Environmental Protection Agency taking account many benefit reduced mercury emission associated reduction nitrogen oxide
But come renewable energy Trump company suddenly worried supposed negative side effect generally exist imagination Last year administration floated proposal would forced operator electricity grid subsidize coal nuclear energy The supposed rationale new source threatening destabilize grid grid operator denied case
So deregulation dire warning imaginary threat others Whats going
Part answer follow money Political contribution meatprocessing industry overwhelmingly favor Republicans Coal mining support GOP almost exclusively Alternative energy hand generally favor Democrats

The House Ways Means Committee last week requested six year Mr Trumps personal tax return along return filed one trust seven subsidiary control They also asked record audit
The return would partly reveal source president income whether business profitable They would show much anything Mr Trump paying tax might show whether aggressive reducing tax bill They show whether Mr Trump personally donated charity
The return requested committee however would fully answer longstanding question identity Mr Trumps business partner ultimate source income whether entangled entity interest administration
Even Representative Richard E Neal Democrat Massachusetts lead committee successful mean tax return become public By law supposed remain solely hand committee unauthorized release would felony
Update House chairman say treasury reason withhold Trumps tax return lack merit
Ever since declared candidacy Mr Trump selfproclaimed billionaire faced question whether exaggerating wealth
Mr Trump never substantiated assertion billionaire though repeatedly made claim bank institution The disclosure tax return probably would settle debate Mr Trumps net worth
Tax return provide list asset liability unless generate income deduction Even return likely would provide value asset liability
Still Mr Trumps full tax return personal return one component Trump Organization would give sense profitability business
The return would also reveal whether company taken hit since entered White House Mr Trump said lost vast amount money since became president
Mr Trump year ran Trump Organization privately held company manages real estate golf resort brand licensing deal interest Much business finance remains unknown
The federal ethic disclosure Mr Trump made holding far limited For example requirement report identity investor put money business
Mr Trump acquired many property particular golf course cash cash come Mr Trumps son Eric told journalist Trump Organizations golf property paid Russian money Eric Trump denied making statement
While Mr Trumps federal filing reported outstanding loan investment income business include debt partial interest older loan paid In theory existence older loan lender behind could disclosed historical tax return certain type interest debt taxdeductible
In reality much information unlikely contained limited number return requested Congress The panel seeking return small number Mr Trumps company But control hundred separate LLCs contain individual business varied particular building right license name overseas Each one business may file tax return separate one requested committee
Mr Trump owns operates business United States overseas He earns revenue golf club membership leasing space building licensing deal put Trump name developer property
Mr Trumps government disclosure report show range much revenue various subsidiary collect provided Mr Trump indicate company overall profitability
For example recent government ethic report state Irish golf business reported revenue 14 million 2017 However Irish regulator require golf subsidiary make filing public Those disclosure show business actually lost 2 million year Mr Trumps return could provide detail profitability business More broadly tax return compared ethic disclosure check accuracy filing
Mr Trumps personal tax return also itemize stock bondmarket transaction people institution receiving income domestic foreign This would include income received bank
If Democrats get Mr Trumps tax looking aggressive illegal maneuver fraudulent tactic used past
Sophisticated tax filer use return paint picture finance want government see It usually take lot digging find going behind number
For example The New York Times reported last year Mr Trump sibling set sham corporation early 1990s disguise million dollar gift parent
In case The Times access far tax return It also relied confidential business filing public record information source document fraud
At time article published lawyer president Charles J Harder said allegation fraud tax evasion 100 percent false highly defamatory
What immediately apparent Mr Trumps tax return sort deduction used reduce tax bill aggressively used
In 1995 example Mr Trump paid income tax record show paid income tax several year
The president said avoided tax generous deduction given real estate owner like One deduction depreciation permit real estate investor deduct portion cost building taxable income
I writeoff A lot depreciation wonderful charge said presidential debate 2016 I love depreciation

WASHINGTON When President Trump met embattled homeland security secretary Sunday force month stormy eruption immigration policy person room Mick Mulvaney made effort head final confrontation instead helped draft letter resignation
When Mr Trump decided get rid Secret Service director official said Mr Mulvaney delivered message rather try talk president When Mr Trump considered whether ask court invalidate Affordable Care Act despite opposition top legal adviser Mr Mulvaneys response Follow gut
In first 100 day president acting chief staff Mr Mulvaney assumed central role Mr Trumps circle one markedly different previous two occupant corner office For first time since taking office Mr Trump chief staff made job encourage rather restrain president conservative instinct let Trump Trump effect
A former congressman South Carolina leader Tea Party movement Mr Mulvaney product Republican establishment like Reince Priebus first chief staff military hierarchy like John F Kelly second Instead arrived White House revolutionary wing conservative movement whose goal even Mr Trump entered politics blow considered corrupt liberal Washington
I dont think see role chief staff alter personality person work said former Representative Trey Gowdy friend fellow South Carolina Republican golfed president Mr Mulvaney last month They good relationship president bos
Some outsider see cascade hardline policy venture unorthodox appointment highlevel purge recent day sign Mr Mulvaneys expanding influence assuming pushing Mr Trump right But insider call misconception insisting Mr Mulvaney pushing open door otherwise merely liberating Mr Trump pursue course prefers
The lesson Mr Mulvaney took unhappy experience Mr Priebus Mr Kelly cast unceremoniously via Twitter comment reporter Mr Trump interested managed aide think know better tried build process think better serf president
To Republicans become resigned ungovernable White House Mr Mulvaney welcome presence one tamped tribal rivalry played vicious form clandestine disclosure news medium
I think he become asset he learned keep Trump train running said Scott Reed top political adviser United States Chamber Commerce A combination managing staff raising morale limiting leaking made successful Trump chief staff
But critic including Republicans Mr Mulvaneys approach unleashed president dangerous way After forcing fiveweek government shutdown start year Mr Trump recent day threatened close nation southern border selected unconventional nominee Federal Reserve despite significant vetting issue began clearing top rank Department Homeland Security
In speech Senate floor Tuesday Senator Chuck Schumer New York Democratic leader lamented chaos White House stemming president whimsical erratic behavior
I hope president people around realize administration far finetuned machine said Its slowmotion disaster machine American people see action every day
Even Republicans Capitol Hill hold Mr Mulvaney low regard particularly senator view former congressman little dealmaking experience scant inclination learn In recent day criticized expanding homeland security purge others complained Mr Mulvaney meet enough
During tense negotiation amid government shutdown earlier year Senator Richard C Shelby Alabama Republican Appropriations Committee chairman complained bitterly Mr Mulvaneys penchant undoing week bipartisan work quick comment Mr Trump Oval Office Mr Shelby told Senator Patrick J Leahy Vermont committee top Democrat Mr Mulvaney dangerous man Washington according three people familiar exchange
Mr Shelby repeated public reporter Capitol Hill asked Mr Mulvaney last week senator tartly interrupted offer correction
You mean acting chief staff said walking away
Mr Trump yet formally remove acting title three month Mr Mulvaney shrug telling others everyone work president serf pleasure therefore acting
Indeed Mr Mulvaney operating temporary caretaker someone expects stay bringing West Wing clutch aide Office Management Budget served director He engaged teambuilding exercise like retreat Camp David recently last week discus effort create replacement Affordable Care Act
He generally liked staff recoiled Mr Kellys military style Mr Kelly made clear hated job muttering loud left many evening might return next day By contrast Mr Mulvaney tell people love job attitude ally said improved morale
Even Democrats praised Mr Mulvaney reaching Representative John Yarmuth Kentucky chairman House Budget Committee said relation Mr Mulvaney excellent noted invited Camp David trustbuilding visit
Micks never going resolve Trumps erratic behavior Mr Yarmuth said Hes never going able anything But I think he much effective chief Kelly
Still Mr Mulvaney criticized internally colleague unwilling identified creating fief And faulted appealing Mr Trumps nativist instinct desire cater hardcore political base
Mr Trump share Mr Mulvaneys special passion hawkish fiscal policy signed largely symbolic budget incorporated priority overrule aide proposed funding cut Special Olympics publicized
The biggest problem I sense Mulvaney politics tends push Trump right even Trump might want go said Leon E Panetta held job President Bill Clinton As chief staff greater responsibility present president option decide
Mr Mulvaney told people strives ensuring president hears different point view During deliberation Affordable Care Act ally noted Mr Mulvaney made sure Mr Trump heard objection lodged Justice Department White House counsel
While Mr Mulvaney kept essence Mr Kellys policydevelopment procedure consults Mr Trump earlier process get direction rather wait end Although known firebrand House stood Republican leader deferential Mr Trump calling bos making point spending hour golf course
In West Wing Mr Mulvaney seen someone know fight battle opposed Mr Kelly often found odds Mr Trumps adult child informal adviser He try manage access president Mr Kelly Rather fight Mr Trumps natural desire meet talk variety people Mr Mulvaney taken decentralized approach call chief staff committee empowering different adviser provide president guidance
It style associated Presidents Gerald R Ford Jimmy Carter resisted strong chief staff first preferring called hub spoke model many people access Oval Office Both eventually abandoned approach concluding work Mr Mulvaney eschews hubandspoke term avoid association failed experiment
People close president say Mr Mulvaney get much credit blame Mr Trumps rightward turn policy Mr Trumps instinct appeal core supporter fear leave one want demonstrate continuing hard line immigration
David Bossie president conservative group Citizens United former deputy campaign manager Mr Trump said president adjusting changing political environment
The president responding new world order thats mindset Mr Bossie said He siege congressional Democrats he operating siege
And Mr Mulvaney trench next

So Voting Rights Act isnt equality giving AfricanAmericans unfair advantage said Which bizarre reading history
Some question felt like factgathering future history Mr Downs asked Ms Abrams reached decision make fiery speech 10 day Georgia election announcing ending campaign pointedly conceding
She said voter suppression often abetted complicity political candidate including loser
Part reason voter suppression work weve created culture say dont challenge outcome election unless act egregious absolutely clear face said Fair Fight Action group allied Ms Abrams filed federal lawsuit challenging Georgias election procedure accusing opponent Brian Kemp Georgia secretary state oversaw election systematically disenfranchising poor minority voter
The scholar offered corrective popular narrative starting argument invoked often Ms Abramss critic Richard Nixon graciously conceded 1960 presidential election good country rather challenge rumored fraudulent vote John F Kennedy
At least thats way Mr Nixon told story book Six Crises Dr Kruse said But fact noted Republican Party begun challenge 11 state dropping
Near end conversation Mr Downs invited question small group observer one person addressed called unspoken political consensus room raising counterargument focus voter suppression strategy getting Democrats elected
Dr Thompson teach University Michigan warned fetishization Democratic Party At every step along historical path Democrats Dixiecrats many time intensely interested disenfranchising poor urban black voter said
Ms Abrams noted appeared Fair Fight Action commercial aired Georgia Super Bowl alongside Republican county commissioner Voter suppression said eviscerate democracy everyone

Golf react get bad bounce
By Thomas L Friedman
Opinion Columnist
Although day job writing foreign affair column The New York Times Persian Gulf fairway golf thinking golf playing often I allconsuming hobby So like million others I awed Tiger Woodss comeback age winning Masters 43 year old What learned
Its hard nongolfers appreciate scope Tigers physical psychological achievement went four back surgery global tabloid exposure industrialscale marital cheating
If I think news I normally cover would Bill Clinton came back defeated Donald Trump president 2020 Or technology equivalent Steve Jobs founding Apple losing Apple coming back winning four technology major Apple desktop laptop iPhone iPad reborn Apple
The biggest takeaway reminder truism golf sport like life played uneven surface everything So good bad bounce selfinflicted mistake built game And much success golf life react good bad bounce Do quit Do throw club Do cheat Do whine Do blame caddie
Or say greatest golfer say bounce turn ball end divot middle fairway great shot get back hole They say caddie two word Watch And pull remarkable shot wind tree hill past sand trap avoids pond left land right middle putting green exactly shot Tiger hit 11th hole tree Augusta National Sunday
To pressure stunning luck even pure physical attribute It practice hour hour hour Gary Player liked say The I practice luckier I get And meaning Tigers comeback begin willingness commit endless hour physical rehabilitation endless hour practice How many u iron But physical part least
Last year I wrote foreword golf instruction book teacher I argued make golf difficult also satisfying get right combine four thing physic geometry geography psychology Tigers genius Sunday often throughout career ability master four better anyone else
How Well every golf swing always start geography quiz How far away target set landscape Is elevated Is ledge Is bowl Is ocean cliff stream pond
Then come geometry lesson At angle speed I launch little white ball match take advantage geography get close possible hole taking account wind temperature landscape well
Then come physic lesson How I move arm leg shift weight speed torque size backswing ball position swing finish ensure little white ball solves geographygeometry riddle land close possible target
And finally emotional psychological mindset I need increase odds body arm move ideal launch position achieve geographygeometry solution Ive designed head As golfer tell greater buzz world solving puzzle body watching golf ball soar toward intended target perfect geometry backdrop stunning geography
Tiger several time Sunday could feel buzz none intensely Augusta Nationals perilous 16th hole launched ball perfect arc water softly curbing right left terrain landing precise twofootdiameter circle would roll 20 foot slope stop 15 inch hole Geography geometry physic psychology working perfect unison
You overestimate psychological aspect shot Golf head game distracted something youll never put geography geometry physic together level needed win professional golf Thats Tigers game deteriorated far infidelity broadcast world 2009 even back gave You could actually see Tiger walked golf gallery back His eye never wanted meet fan knew knew knew knew hed firstclass jerk
What head translated hand translated score For better part decade could win major back healed got monkey misdeed back becoming good father better person fan fellow golfer You could see looking everyone eye last couple year finally unlocked fan base It gave permission root fullthroated despite way hed disappointed And clearly unlocked mind I sure body could swing freely
And lead another way golf much like life Each every round journey like life journey never straight line Its always full crazy bounce selfinflicted mistake unexpected detour therefore always journey discovery playing partner And love game everlasting journey search selfimprovement always trying get geography geometry physic psychology perfect alignment
And see done highest level toughest terrain intense spotlight someone lost got back say What privilege I saw Tiger make comeback win Masters age 43 What crazy wonderful amazing journey

At heart waiver two point whether language clear bargaining power person asked sign waiver
A lot time people arent even aware language Mr Wickert said Oftentimes hindsight question The court say If read would understood
In Florida state look whether service area covered waiver essential public like park If waiver valid A golf course fall public service designation But ClubCorp waiver would enforced clear

On Sunday Molinari gauged swirling breeze pulled eightiron took aim pin cut right side angling green longer carry water unnecessary risk circumstance
His ball barely cleared creek landing bank rolling back
Just bad execution Molinari lamented afterwards I think picked right shot
I trying hit chippy eightiron It probably nineiron yardage I didnt want wind gust get ball much I didnt hit hard enough
That ball one yard left probably go bunker
Even subsequent double bogey Molinari still hunt poorly played 15th hole compounded bit bad luck finally sunk
A wayward drive forced lay parfive got bit greedy wedge third shot 90 yard aiming pin instead taking medicine steering well clear tree trouble heart green
His ball clipped pine tree came pond guarding green
The stoic Molinari hardly betrayed thought inside must numb
It obviously close branch tree never know probably doesnt clip branch might go close hole said
But I probably gone middle green wait last three hole try make something happen
Molinari eventually shot 74 finish equal fifth two stroke behind champion Woods 11underpar 277
POOR FINISH
Earlier started day twoshot lead sank 13foot parsaving putt first hole least set tone
He gone 49 consecutive hole without dropping shot one shy alltime Masters record poor drive parfour seventh cost bogey
Five hole later wheel came
The poor finish notwithstanding 36yearold established one best world past year always Claret Jug name
But rue might perhaps unlikely ever get better chance
Sometimes day sometimes isnt Im really happy way I felt today said
I calm collected never panicked even first double bogey
Ive done couple thing I wish I done differently Ill learn mistake

The Office considered whether charge Trump Campaign official crime connection June 9 meeting described Volume I Section IVA5 supra The Office concluded light government substantial burden proof issue intent knowing willful difficulty establishing value offered information criminal charge would meet Justice Manual standard admissible evidence probably sufficient obtain sustain conviction Justice Manual 927220
In brief key fact June 3 2016 Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr pas along Emin Aras Agalarov offer Russias Crown prosecutor Trump campaign official document information would incriminate Hillary dealing Russia would useful Trump Jrs father The email described high level sensitive information part Russia government support Mr Trumphelped along Aras Emin Trump Jr responded say I love especially later summer Trump Jr Emin Agalarov followup conversation within day scheduled meeting Russian representative attended Trump Jr Manafort Kushner The communication setting meeting attendance highlevel Campaign representative support inference Campaign anticipated receiving derogatory document information official Russian source could assist candidate Trumps electoral prospect
This series event could implicate federal electionlaw ban contribution donation foreign national 52 USC 30121a1A Specifically Goldstone passed along offer purportedly Russian government official provide official document information Trump Campaign purpose influencing presidential election Trump Jr appears accepted offer arranged meeting receive material Documentary evidence form email chain support inference Kushner Manafort aware purpose attended June 9 meeting anticipating receipt helpful information Campaign Russian source
The Office considered whether evidence would establish conspiracy violate foreign contribution ban violation 18 USC 371 solicitation illegal foreignsource contribution acceptance receipt express implied promise make
Vol 1 Page 185
foreignsource contribution violation 52 USC 30121a1A a2 There reasonable argument offered information would constitute thing value within meaning provision Office determined government would likely obtain sustain conviction two reason first Office obtain admissible evidence likely meet government burden prove beyond reasonable doubt individual acted willfully ie general knowledge illegality conduct second government would likely encounter difficulty proving beyond reasonable doubt value promised information exceeded threshold criminal violation see 52 USC 30109d1Ai
A threshold legal question whether providing campaign document information type involved would constitute prohibited campaign contribution The foreign contribution ban limited contribution money It expressly prohibits contribution donation money thing value 52 USC 30121a1A a2 emphasis added And term contribution defined throughout campaignfinance law include gift subscription loan advance deposit money anything value 52 USC 301018Ai emphasis added
The phrase thing value anything value broad inclusive enough encompass least form valuable information Throughout United States Code phrase serve term art construed broadly United States v Nilsen 967 F2d 539542 11th Cir 1992 per curiam thing value includes tangibles intangible see also eg 18 USC 201b1 666a2 bribery statute id 641 theft government property For example term thing value encompasses law enforcement report would reveal identity informant United States v Girard 601 F2d 69 71 2d Cir 1979 classified material United States v Fowler 932 F2d 306 310 4th Cir 1991 confidential information competitive bid United States v Matzkin 14 F3d 1014 1020 4th Cir 1994 secret grand jury information United States v Jeter 775 F2d 670 680 6th Cir 1985 information witness whereabouts United States v Sheker 618 F2d 607 609 9th Cir 1980 per curiam And public corruption context thing value defined broadly include value defendant subjectively attache item received United States v Renzi 769 F3d 731 744 9th Cir 2014 internal quotation mark omitted
Federal Election Commission FEC regulation recognize value campaign least form information stating term anything value includes provision good service without charge membership list mailing list 11 CFR 10052d1 The FEC concluded phrase includes statebystate list activist See Citizens Responsibility Ethics Washington v FEC 475 F3d 337 338 DC Cir 2007 describing FECs finding Likewise polling data provided campaign constitutes contribution FEC Advisory Opinion 199012 Strub 1990 WL 153454 citing 11 CFR 1064b And specific context foreigncontributions ban FEC concluded election material used previous Canadian campaign including flyer advertisement door hanger trifolds sign printed material constitute anything

These authority would support view candidaterelated opposition research given campaign purpose influencing election could constitute contribution foreignsource ban could apply A campaign assisted provision fund also provision derogatory information opponent Political campaign frequently conduct pay opposition research A foreign entity engaged research provided resulting information campaign could exert greater effect election greater tendency ingratiate donor candidate gift money tangible thing value At time judicial decision treated voluntary provision uncompensated opposition research similar information thing value could amount contribution campaignfinance law Such interpretation could implication beyond foreignsource ban see 52 USC 30116a imposing monetary limit campaign contribution raise First Amendment question Those question could especially difficult information consisted simply recounting historically accurate fact It uncertain court would resolve issue
Even assuming promised document information would incriminate Hillary constitute thing value campaignfinance law government would encounter challenge seeking obtain sustain conviction Most significantly government obtained admissible evidence likely establish scienter requirement beyond reasonable doubt To prove defendant acted knowingly willfully government would show defendant general knowledge conduct unlawful US Department Justice Federal Prosecution Election Offenses 123 8th ed Dec 2017 Election Offenses see Bluman 800 F Supp 2d 292 noting willful violation requires proof defendant knowledge law Danielczyk 917 F Supp 2d 577 knowledge general unlawfulness This standard creates elevated scienter element requiring least application law fact question fairly clear When substantial doubt concerning whether law applies fact particular matter offender likely intent defense Election Offenses 123
On fact government would unlikely able prove beyond reasonable doubt June 9 meeting participant general knowledge conduct unlawful The investigation developed evidence participant meeting familiar foreigncontribution ban application federal law relevant factual context The government strong evidence surreptitious behavior effort concealment time June 9 meeting While government evidence later effort prevent disclosure nature June 9 meeting could circumstantially provide support showing scienter see Volume II Section IIG infra concealment occurred year later involved individual attend June 9 meeting may reflect intention avoid political consequence rather prior knowledge illegality Additionally light unresolved legal question whether giving document information sort offered constitutes campaign contribution Trump Jr could mount factual defense
Vol 1 Page 187
believe response offer June 9 meeting violated law Given le direct involvement arranging June 9 meeting Kushner could likely mount similar defense And Manafort experienced political campaign Office developed evidence showing relevant knowledge legal issue
The Office would also encounter difficulty proving beyond reasonable doubt value promised document information exceeds 2000 threshold criminal violation well 25000 threshold felony punishment See 52 USC 30109d1 The type evidence commonly used establish value nonmonetary contribution pricing contribution commercial market determining upstream acquisition cost cost distribution would likely unavailable ineffective factual setting Although damaging opposition research surely valuable campaign appears information ultimately delivered meeting valuable And value conspiracy may well measured participant expected receive time agreement see eg United States v Tombrello 666 F2d 485 489 11th Cir 1982 Goldstones description offered material quite general His suggestion information value ie would incriminate Hillary would useful Trump Jrs father nonspecific may understood uncertain worth reliability given Goldstones lack direct access original source The uncertainty would delivered could reflected Trump Jrs response say I love emphasis added
Accordingly taking account high burden establish culpable mental state campaignfinance prosecution difficulty establishing required valuation Office decided pursue criminal campaignfinance charge Trump Jr campaign official event culminating June 9 meeting

Overarching factual issue We make traditional prosecution decision fact evidence obtained support several general statement Presidents conduct
Several feature conduct investigated distinguish typical obstructionofjustice case First investigation concerned President action firing FBI director involved facially lawful act within Article II authority raise constitutional issue discussed At time Presidents position head Executive Branch provided unique powerful mean influencing official proceeding subordinate officer potential witness relevant potential obstructionofjustice analysis1 Second unlike case subject engages obstruction justice cover crime evidence obtained establish President involved underlying crime related Russian election interference Although obstruction statute require proof crime absence evidence affect analysis Presidents intent requires consideration possible motif conduct Third many Presidents act directed witness including discouragement cooperation government suggestion possible future pardon took place public view That circumstance unusual principle law excludes public act reach obstruction law If likely effect public act influence witness alter testimony harm justice system integrity
Although series event investigated involved discrete act overall pattern Presidents conduct towards investigation shed light nature Presidents act inference drawn intent In particular action investigated divided two phase reflecting possible shift Presidents motif The first phase covered period Presidents first interaction Comey Presidents firing Comey During time President repeatedly told personally investigation Soon firing Comey appointment Special Counsel however President became aware conduct investigated obstructionofjustice inquiry At point President engaged second phase conduct involving public attack investigation nonpublic effort control effort public private encourage witness cooperate investigation Judgments nature Presidents motif phase would informed totality evidence
The Presidents counsel raised statutory constitutional defense possible obstructionofjustice analysis conduct investigated We concluded none legal defense provided basis declining investigate fact
Statutory defense Consistent precedent Department Justices general approach interpreting obstruction statute concluded several statute could apply See 18 USC 1503 1505 1512b3 1512c2 Section 1512c2 omnibus obstructionofjustice provision cover range obstructive act directed pending contemplated official proceeding No principle statutory construction justifies narrowing provision cover conduct impairs integrity availability evidence Sections 1503 1505 also offer broad protection obstructive act directed pending grand jury
Vol 2 Page 7
judicial administrative congressional proceeding supplemented provision Section 1512b aimed specifically conduct intended prevent hinder communication law enforcement information related federal crime
Constitutional defense As constitutional defense arising Presidents status head Executive Branch recognized Department Justice court definitively resolved issue We therefore examined issue framework established Supreme Court precedent governing separationofpowers issue The Department Justice Presidents personal counsel recognized President subject statute prohibit obstruction justice bribing witness suborning perjury conduct implicate constitutional authority With respect whether President found obstructed justice exercising power Article II Constitution concluded Congress authority prohibit Presidents corrupt use authority order protect integrity administration justice
Under applicable Supreme Court precedent Constitution categorically permanently immunize President obstructing justice use Article II power The separationofpowers doctrine authorizes Congress protect official proceeding including court grand jury corrupt obstructive act regardless source We also concluded inroad presidential authority would occur prohibiting corrupt act undermine Presidents ability fulfill constitutional mission The term corruptly set demanding standard It requires concrete showing person acted intent obtain improper advantage someone else inconsistent official duty right others A preclusion corrupt official action diminish Presidents ability exercise Article II power For example proper supervision criminal law demand freedom President act corrupt intention shielding criminal punishment avoiding financial liability preventing personal embarrassment To contrary statute prohibits official action undertaken corrupt purpose furthers rather hinders impartial evenhanded administration law It also aligns Presidents constitutional duty faithfully execute law Finally concluded rare case criminal investigation Presidents conduct justified inquiry determine whether President acted corrupt motive impermissibly chill performance constitutionally assigned duty The conclusion Congress may apply obstruction law Presidents corrupt exercise power office accord constitutional system check balance principle person law
Because determined make traditional prosecutorial judgment draw ultimate conclusion Presidents conduct The evidence obtained Presidents action intent present difficult issue would need resolved making traditional prosecutorial judgment At time confidence thorough investigation fact President clearly commit obstruction justice would state Based fact applicable legal standard unable reach judgment Accordingly report conclude President committed crime also exonerate

Taking account information analysis applicable statutory constitutional principle discussed Volume II Section III infra determined sufficient factual legal basis investigate potential obstructionofjustice issue involving President
Many core issue obstructionofjustice investigation turn individual action intent We therefore requested White House provide u documentary evidence possession relevant event We also sought obtained White Houses concurrence conducting interview White House personnel relevant information And interviewed witness pertinent knowledge obtained document
Vol 2 Page 12
voluntary basis possible used legal process appropriate These investigative step allowed u gather substantial amount evidence
We also sought voluntary interview President After year discussion President declined interviewed During course discussion President agree answer written question certain Russiarelated topic provided u answer He similarly agree provide written answer question obstruction topic question event transition Ultimately believed authority legal justification issue grand jury subpoena obtain Presidents testimony chose We made decision view substantial delay investigative step would likely produce late stage investigation We also assessed based significant body evidence already obtained Presidents action public private statement describing explaining action sufficient evidence understand relevant event make certain assessment without Presidents testimony1 The Offices decisionmaking process issue described detail Appendix C infra note precedes Presidents written response
In assessing evidence obtained relied common principle apply investigation The issue criminal intent often inferred circumstantial evidence See eg United States v Croteau 819 F3d 1293 1305 11th Cir 2016 Guilty knowledge rarely established direct evidence Therefore men rea element knowledge intent may proved circumstantial evidence internal quotation mark omitted United States v Robinson 702 F3d 22 36 2d Cir 2012 The government case rested circumstantial evidence men rea element knowledge intent often proved circumstantial evidence reasonable inference drawn therefrom internal quotation mark omitted The principle intent inferred circumstantial evidence necessity criminal case given right subject assert privilege compelled selfincrimination Fifth Amendment therefore decline testify Accordingly determination intent frequently reached without opportunity interview investigatory subject
Obstructionofjustice case consistent rule See eg Edlind 887 F3d 174 176 relying significant circumstantial evidence defendant conscious wrongdoing obstruction case evidence intent almost always circumstantial defendant may found culpable reasonable foreseeable consequence act obstruction justice internal quotation mark ellipsis punctuation omitted Quattrone 441 F3d 173174 Circumstantial evidence illuminates intent may include pattern potentially obstructive act Fed R Evid 404b Evidence crime wrong act may admissible prove motive opportunity intent preparation plan knowledge identity absence mistake lack accident see eg United States v Frankhauser 80 F3d 641 648650 1st Cir 1996 United States v Arnold 773 F2d 823 832834 7th Cir 1985 Cintolo 818 F2d 1000
Credibility judgment may also made based objective fact circumstantial evidence Standard jury instruction highlight variety factor often relevant

assessing credibility These include whether witness reason tell truth whether witness good memory whether witness opportunity observe event testified whether witness testimony corroborated witness whether anything witness said wrote previously contradicts testimony See eg First Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions 106 2018 Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions Criminal Cases 108 2012 Seventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction 8 301 2012
In addition general factor took account specific factor assessing credibility conflicting account fact For example contemporaneous written note provide strong corroborating evidence See United States v Nobles 422 US 225 232 1975 fact statement appeared contemporaneously recorded report would tend strongly corroborate investigator version interview Similarly witness recitation account motive fabricate also support witness credibility See Tome v United States 513 US 150 158 1995 A consistent statement predates motive square rebuttal charge testimony contrived consequence motive Finally witness false description encounter imply consciousness wrongdoing See AlAdahi v Obama 613 F3d 1102 1107 DC Cir 2010 noting wellsettled principle false exculpatory statement evidenceoften strong evidence guilt We applied settled legal principle evaluating factual result investigation

historic proportion266 In late March early April President asked McFarland pas message Flynn telling President felt bad stay strong267
In analyzing Presidents conduct related Flynn investigation following evidence relevant element obstruction justice
Obstructive act According Comeys account February 14 2017 meeting Oval Office President told I hope see way clear letting go letting Flynn go I hope let go In analyzing whether statement constitute obstructive act threshold question whether Comeys account interaction accurate whether Presidents statement tendency impede administration justice shutting inquiry could result grand jury investigation criminal charge
After Comeys account Presidents request let Flynn go became public President publicly disputed several aspect story The President told New York Times shoo people room talked Comey remember oneonone conversation Comey268 The President also publicly denied asked Comey let Flynn go otherwise communicated Comey drop investigation Flynn269 In private President denied aspect Comeys account White House advisor acknowledged Priebus brought Flynn meeting Comey stated Flynn good guy279 Despite denial substantial evidence corroborates Comeys account

269 In statement May 16 2017 White House said While President repeatedly expressed view General Flynn decent man served protected country President never asked Mr Comey anyone else end investigation including investigation involving General Flynn This truthful accurate portrayal conversation President Mr Comey See Michael S Schmidt Comey Memorandum Says Trump Asked Him End Flynn Investigation New York Times May 16 2017 quoting White House statement realDonald Trump 12317 615 ET Tweet I never asked Comey stop investigating Flynn Just Fake News covering another Comey lie
270 Priebus recalled President acknowledged telling Comey Flynn good guy hoped everything worked Priebus 101317 302 19 McGahn recalled President denied saying Comey hoped Comey would let Flynn go added allowed hope The President told McGahn think crossed line McGahn 121417 302 8
Vol 2 Page 44
First Comey wrote detailed memorandum encounter President day occurred Comey also told senior FBI official meeting President day recollection Comey told time consistent Comeys account271
Second Comey provided testimony Presidents request let Flynn go oath congressional proceeding interview federal investigator subject penalty lying 18 USC 1001 Comeys recollection encounter remained consistent time
Third objective corroborated circumstance oneonone meeting came occur support Comeys description event Comey recalled President cleared room speak Comey alone homeland security briefing Oval Office Kushner Sessions lingered shooed President Priebus briefly opened door meeting prompting President wave away While President publicly denied detail Administration official present confirmed Comeys account ended oneonone meeting President272 And President acknowledged Priebus McGahn fact spoke Comey Flynn oneonone meeting
Fourth Presidents decision clear room particular exclude Attorney General meeting signal President wanted alone Comey consistent delivery message type Comey recall rather innocuous conversation could occurred presence Attorney General
Finally Comeys reaction Presidents statement consistent President asked let Flynn go Comey met FBI leadership team agreed keep Presidents statement closely held inform team working Flynn investigation would influenced Presidents request Comey also promptly met Attorney General ask left alone President account verified Sessions FBI Chief Staff James Rybicki Jody Hunt Attorney Generals chief staff
A second question whether Presidents statement phrased direct order Comey could impede interfere FBIs investigation Flynn While President said hoped Comey could let Flynn go rather affirmatively directing circumstance conversation show President asking Comey close FBIs investigation Flynn First President arranged meeting Comey would alone purposely excluded Attorney General suggests President meant make request Comey want anyone else hear Second President head Executive Branch say hope subordinate something reasonable expect subordinate President want Indeed President repeated version let go three time Comey

testified understood Presidents statement directive corroborated way Comey reacted time
b Nexus proceeding To establish nexus proceeding would necessary show President could reasonably foresee actually contemplated investigation Flynn likely lead grand jury investigation prosecution
At time Presidents oneonone meeting Comey grand jury subpoena issued part FBIs investigation Flynn But Flynns lie FBI violated federal criminal law resulted Flynns prosecution violating 18 USC 1001 By time President spoke Comey Flynn DOJ official informed McGahn informed President Flynns statement senior White House official contact Kislyak true Flynn told version event FBI McGahn also informed President Flynns conduct could violate 18 USC 1001 After Vice President senior White House official reviewed underlying information Flynns call February 10 2017 believed Flynn could forgotten conversation Kislyak concluded lying In addition Presidents instruction FBI Director let Flynn go suggests awareness Flynn could face criminal exposure conduct risk prosecution
c Intent As part investigation examined whether President personal stake outcome investigation Flynnfor example whether President aware Flynns communication Kislyak close time occurred President knew Flynn lied senior White House official lie passed public Some evidence suggests President knew existence content Flynns call occurred evidence inconclusive could relied upon establish Presidents knowledge In advance Flynns initial call Kislyak President attended meeting sanction discussed advisor may mentioned Flynn scheduled talk Kislyak Flynn told McFarland substance call Kislyak said may made difference Russias response Flynn recalled talking Bannon early January 2017 successfully stopped train Russias response sanction It would reasonable Flynn wanted President know communication Kislyak Kislyak told Flynn request received highest level Russia Russia chosen retaliate response request President pleased Russian response calling great move And President never said publicly internally Flynn lied call Kislyak
But McFarland recall providing PresidentElect Flynns readout call Kislyak Flynn specific recollection telling PresidentElect directly call Bannon also said recall hearing call Flynn And February 2017 President asked Flynn discussed call whether lied Vice President suggesting already know Our investigation accordingly produce evidence established President knew Flynns discussion sanction Department Justice notified White House discussion late January 2017 The evidence also establish Flynn otherwise
Vol 2 Page 46
possessed information damaging President would give President personal incentive end FBIs inquiry Flynns conduct
Evidence establish President connected Flynn investigation FBIs broader Russia investigation believed told Christie terminating Flynn would end whole Russia thing Flynns firing occurred time medium Congress raising question Russias interference election whether member Presidents campaign colluded Russia Multiple witness recalled President viewed Russia investigation challenge legitimacy election The President paid careful attention negative coverage Flynn reacted annoyance anger story broke disclosing Flynn discussed sanction Kislyak Just hour meeting oneonone Comey President told Christie firing Flynn would put end Russia inquiry And Christie pushed back telling President firing Flynn would end Russia investigation President asked Christie reach Comey convey President liked part team That afternoon President cleared room asked Comey let Flynn go
We also sought evidence relevant assessing whether Presidents direction Comey motivated sympathy towards Flynn In public statement President repeatedly described Flynn good person harmed Russia investigation President directed advisor reach Flynn tell President cared felt bad At time multiple senior advisor including Bannon Priebus Hicks said President become unhappy Flynn well Flynn forced resign President frequently irritated Flynn Priebus said believed Presidents initial reluctance fire Flynn stemmed personal regard concern negative press would generated firing National Security Advisor early Administration And Priebus indicated Presidents postfiring expression support Flynn motivated Presidents desire keep Flynn saying negative thing
The way President communicated request Comey also relevant understanding Presidents intent When President first learned FBI investigation Flynn told McGahn Bannon Priebus discus matter anyone else White House The next day President invited Comey oneonone dinner advice aide recommended White House official also attend At dinner President asked Comey loyalty different point conversation mentioned Flynn judgment issue When President met Comey day Flynns terminationshortly told Christie firing Flynn would end Russia investigationthe President cleared room even excluding Attorney General could speak Comey alone The Presidents decision meet oneonone Comey contravened advice White House Counsel President communicate directly Department Justice avoid appearance interfering law enforcement activity And President later denied cleared room asked Comey let Flynn goa denial would unnecessary believed request proper exercise prosecutorial discretion
Vol 2 Page 47
Finally Presidents effort McFarland write internal email denying President directed Flynn discus sanction Kislyak highlight Presidents concern associated Flynns conduct The evidence establish President trying McFarland lie The Presidents request however sufficiently irregular McFarlandwho know full extent Flynns communication President thus could make representation President wantedfelt need draft internal memorandum documenting Presidents request Eisenberg concerned request would look like quid pro quo exchange ambassadorship

In analyzing Presidents decision fire Comey following evidence relevant element obstruction justice
Obstructive act The act firing Comey removed individual overseeing FBIs Russia investigation The President knew Comey personally involved investigation based Comeys briefing Gang Eight Comeys March 20 2017 public testimony investigation Presidents oneonone conversation Comey
Firing Comey would qualify obstructive act natural probable effect interfering impeding investigationfor example termination would effect delaying disrupting investigation providing President opportunity appoint director would take different approach investigation President perceived protective personal interest Relevant circumstance bearing issue include whether Presidents action potential discourage successor director law enforcement official conduct Russia investigation The President fired Comey abruptly without offering opportunity resign banned FBI building criticized publicly calling showboat claiming FBI turmoil leadership And President followed termination public statement highly critical investigation example three day firing Comey President referred investigation witch hunt asked end Those action potential affect successor director conduct investigation
The anticipated effect removing FBI director however would necessarily prevent impede FBI continuing investigation As general matter FBI investigation run operational direction FBI personnel level FBI director Bannon made similar point told President could fire FBI director could fire FBI The White House issued press statement day Comey fired said The investigation would always continued obviously termination Comey would ended In addition May 11 interview Lester Holt President stated understood made decision fire Comey action might prolong investigation And President chose McCabe serve interim director even

though McCabe told President worked closely Comey part decision made Clinton investigation
b Nexus proceeding The nexus element would satisfied evidence showing grand jury proceeding criminal prosecution arising FBI investigation objectively foreseeable actually contemplated President terminated Comey
Several fact would relevant showing At time President fired Comey grand jury begun hear evidence related Russia investigation grand jury subpoena issued On March 20 2017 however Comey announced FBI investigating Russias interference election including assessment whether crime committed It widely known FBI part Russia investigation investigating hacking DNCs computer clear criminal offense
In addition time President fired Comey evidence indicates President knew Flynn still criminal investigation could potentially prosecuted despite Presidents February 14 2017 request Comey let Flynn go On March 5 2017 White House Counsels Office informed FBI asking transitionperiod record relating Flynnindicating FBI still actively investigating The day President told advisor wanted call Dana Boente Acting Attorney General Russia investigation find whether White House President investigated On March 31 2017 President signaled awareness Flynn remained legal jeopardy tweeting Mike Flynn ask immunity agreed provide testimony FBI Congress And late March early April President asked McFarland pas message Flynn telling President felt bad stay strong demonstrating Presidents awareness Flynns criminal exposure
c Intent Substantial evidence indicates catalyst Presidents decision fire Comey Comeys unwillingness publicly state President personally investigation despite Presidents repeated request Comey make announcement1 In week leading Comeys May 3 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee testimony President told McGahn would last straw Comey set record straight publicly announce President investigation But May 3 testimony Comey refused answer question whether President investigated Comeys refusal angered President criticized Sessions leaving isolated exposed saying You left island Two day later President told advisor decided fire Comey dictated letter Stephen Miller began reference fact President investigated While I greatly appreciate informing I investigation concerning I often stated fabricated story TrumpRussia relationship The President later asked Rosenstein include Russia memorandum say Comey told President investigation And Presidents final termination letter included sentence Presidents insistence McGahns advice stating Comey told President three separate occasion investigation
The Presidents stated rationale fired Comey similarly supported evidence The termination letter President Stephen Miller prepared Bedminster

cited Comeys handling Clinton email investigation President told McCabe fired Comey reason But fact surrounding Comeys handling Clinton email investigation well known President time assumed office President made clear Comey Presidents senior staff early 2017 wanted Comey stay director And Rosenstein articulated criticism Comeys handling Clinton investigation President already decided fire Comey The Presidents draft termination letter also stated morale FBI alltime low Sanders told press Comeys termination White House heard countless FBI agent lost confidence Comey But evidence support claim The President told Comey January 27 dinner people FBI really like evidence suggests President heard otherwise deciding terminate Comey Sanders acknowledged investigator comment founded anything
We also considered important President Comey announce publicly investigation Some evidence indicates President believed erroneous perception investigation harmed ability manage domestic foreign affair particularly dealing Russia The President told Comey cloud Russia business making difficult run country The President told Sessions McGahn foreign leader expressed sympathy investigation perception investigation hurting ability address foreign relation issue The President complained Rogers thing Russians messing ability get thing done Russia told Coats I cant anything Russia there thing Id like Russia trade ISIS theyre The President also may viewed Comey insubordinate failure make clear May 3 testimony President investigation
Other evidence however indicates President wanted protect investigation campaign The day learning FBIs interview Flynn President oneonone dinner Comey advice senior aide told Comey needed Comeys loyalty When President later asked Comey second time make public investigation brought loyalty saying Because I loyal loyal thing know After President learned Sessionss recusal Russia investigation President furious said wanted Attorney General would protect way perceived Robert Kennedy Eric Holder protected president The President also said wanted able tell Attorney General investigate
In addition President motive put FBIs Russia investigation behind The evidence establish termination Comey designed cover conspiracy Trump Campaign Russia As described Volume I evidence uncovered investigation establish President close involved charged Russian computerhacking activemeasure conspiracy President otherwise unlawful relationship Russian official But evidence indicate thorough FBI investigation would uncover fact campaign President personally President could understood crime would give rise personal political concern Although President publicly stated election connection Russia Trump Organization Michael Cohen

time public report stated Russian intelligence official behind hack Trump privately sought information future WikiLeaks releases499 More broadly multiple witness described Presidents preoccupation press coverage Russia investigation persistent concern raised question legitimacy election500
Finally President White House aide initially advanced pretextual reason press public Comeys termination In immediate aftermath firing President dictated press statement suggesting acted based DOJ recommendation White House press official repeated story But President decided fire Comey White House solicited recommendation Although President ultimately acknowledged going fire Comey regardless Department Justices recommendation DOJ official made clear would resist White Houses suggestion prompted process led Comeys termination The initial reliance pretextual justification could support inference President concern providing real reason firing although evidence resolve whether concern personal political 1

backed would budge 828 Following Oval Office meeting Presidents personal counsel called McGahns counsel relayed President fine McGahn 829
In analyzing Presidents effort McGahn deny ordered Special Counsel removed following evidence relevant element obstruction justice
Obstructive act The Presidents repeated effort get McGahn create record denying President directed remove Special Counsel would qualify obstructive act natural tendency constrain McGahn testifying truthfully undermine credibility potential witness testified consistently memory rather record said
There evidence time New York Times Washington Post story published late January 2018 President believed story wrong never told McGahn Rosenstein remove Special Counsel The President correctly understood McGahn told President directly planned resign In addition President told Priebus Porter sought terminate Special Counsel Oval Office meeting McGahn President said I never said fire Mueller I never said fire That evidence could indicate President attempting persuade McGahn change story instead offering differentrecollection substance June 2017 conversation McGahn McGahns reaction
Other evidence cut understanding Presidents conduct As previously described see Volume II Section IIE supra substantial evidence support McGahns account President directed Special Counsel removed including timing context Presidents directive manner McGahn reacted fact President told conflict insubstantial considered Department Justice raised Presidents personal counsel rather brought McGahn In addition Presidents subsequent denial told McGahn Special Counsel removed carefully worded When first asked New York Times story President said Fake news folk Fake news A typical New York Times fake story And President spoke McGahn Oval Office focused whether used word fire saying I never said fire Mueller I never said fire Did I say word fire The Presidents assertion Oval Office meeting never directed McGahn Special Counsel removed thus run counter evidence
In addition even President sincerely disagreed McGahns memory June 17 2017 event evidence indicates President knew time Oval Office

meeting McGahns account differed McGahn firm view Shortly story broke Presidents counsel told McGahns counsel President wanted McGahn make statement denying asked fire Special Counsel McGahn responded counsel aspect story accurate therefore could comply Presidents request The President directed Sanders tell McGahn correct story McGahn told would story accurate reporting Presidents order Consistent position McGahn never issued correction More week later President brought issue Porter made comment indicating President thought McGahn leaked story directed Porter McGahn create record denying President tried fire Special Counsel At point President said might get rid McGahn McGahn comply McGahn refused told Porter told Sanders counsel told Presidents counsel President fact ordered Rosenstein remove Special Counsel That evidence indicates time Oval Office meeting President aware McGahn think story false want issue statement create written record denying fact McGahn believed true The President nevertheless persisted asked McGahn repudiate fact McGahn repeatedly said accurate
b Nexus official proceeding By January 2018 Special Counsels use grand jury confirmed return several indictment The President also aware Special Counsel investigating obstructionrelated event among reason January 8 2018 Special Counsels Office provided counsel detailed list topic possible interview President 830 The President knew McGahn personal knowledge many event Special Counsel investigating McGahn already interviewed Special Counsel investigator And Oval Office meeting President indicated knew McGahn told Special Counsels Office Presidents effort remove Special Counsel The President challenged McGahn disclosing information taking note viewed creating unnecessary legal exposure That evidence indicates Presidents awareness June 17 2017 event relevant Special Counsels investigation grand jury investigation might grow
To establish nexus would necessary show Presidents action would natural tendency affect proceeding would hinder delay prevent communication information investigator Because McGahn spoken Special Counsel investigator January 2018 President could seeking influence prior statement interview But McGahn repeatedly spoken investigator obstruction inquiry complete foreseeable would interviewed obstructionrelated topic If President focused solely press strategy seeking McGahn refute New York Times article nexus proceeding investigative interview would shown But Presidents effort McGahn write letter record approximately ten day story come well past typical

Vol 2 Page 119
time issue correction news story indicates President focused solely press strategy instead likely contemplated ongoing investigation proceeding arising
c Intent Substantial evidence indicates repeatedly urging McGahn dispute ordered Special Counsel terminated President acted purpose influencing McGahns account order deflect prevent scrutiny Presidents conduct towards investigation
Several fact support conclusion The President made repeated attempt get McGahn change story As described time last attempt evidence suggests President told multiple occasion McGahn believed President ordered Special Counsel terminated McGahn interpreted encounter President Oval Office attempt test mettle see committed memory occurred The President already laid groundwork pressing McGahn alter account telling Porter might necessary fire McGahn deny story Porter relayed statement McGahn Additional evidence Presidents intent may gleaned fact counsel sufficiently alarmed prospect Presidents meeting McGahn called McGahns counsel said McGahn could resign matter happened Oval Office day The Presidents counsel well aware McGahns resolve issue believed false account event despite Presidents request Finally noted President brought Special Counsel investigation Oval Office meeting McGahn criticized telling Office June 17 2017 event The Presidents statement reflect understanding displeasure event would part obstructionofjustice inquiry
In addition interaction McGahn described President taken action directed possible witness Special Counsels investigation including Flynn Manafort described next section Cohen When Flynn withdrew joint defense agreement President Presidents personal counsel stated Flynns action would viewed reflecting hostility towards President During Manaforts prosecution jury deliberating President repeatedly stated Manafort treated unfairly made known Manafort could receive pardon

Vol 2 Page 152
In analyzing Presidents conduct related Cohen following evidence relevant element obstruction justice
Obstructive act We gathered evidence Presidents conduct related Cohen two issue whether President others aided participated Cohens false statement Congress ii whether President took action would natural tendency prevent Cohen providing truthful information government
First regard Cohens false statement Congress evidence described President knew Cohen provided false testimony Congress Trump Tower Moscow project evidence available u establish President directed aided Cohens false testimony 1
Cohen said statement Congress followed party line developed within campaign align Presidents public statement distancing President Russia Cohen also recalled speaking President advance testifying made clear would stay messagewhich Cohen believed understood would require false testimony But Cohen said President explicitly discus whether Cohens testimony Trump Tower Moscow project would false President direct provide false testimony Cohen also said tell President specific planned testimony During time statement Congress drafted circulated member JDA Cohen speak directly President statement rather communicated Presidents personal counselas corroborated phone record showing extensive communication Cohen Presidents personal counsel Cohen submitted statement testified Congress
Cohen recalled discussion Presidents personal counsel August 27 2017the day Cohens statement submitted CongressCohen said communication Russia communication candidate Trump statement reflected Cohen recalled expressing concern time According Cohen Presidents personal counselwho firsthand knowledge projectresponded saying need muddy water unnecessary include detail project take place Cohen keep statement short tight elaborate stay message contradict President Cohens recollection content conversation consistent direction substance Cohens draft statement appeared come member JDA For example Cohen omitted reference outreach Russian government official set meeting Trump Putin United Nations General Assembly Cohen believed decision
Vol 2 Page 153
JDA delete sentence The building project led make limited contact Russian government official
The Presidents personal counsel declined provide u account conversation Cohen evidence available u indicates President aware information Cohen provided Presidents personal counsel The Presidents conversation personal counsel presumptively protected attorneyclient privilege seek obtain content communication The absence evidence President counsel conversation drafting Cohens statement precludes u assessing role President played
ii Second considered whether President took action would natural tendency prevent Cohen providing truthful information criminal investigator Congress
Before Cohen began cooperate government President publicly privately urged Cohen stay message flip Cohen recalled Presidents personal counsel telling would protected long go rogue In day week followed April 2018 search Cohens home office President told reporter Cohen good man said fine person wonderful family I always liked respected Privately President told Cohen hang stay strong People close Cohen President passed message Cohen President love bos love everyone know bos back Through Presidents personal counsel President also previously told Cohen thanks Cohen provided information medium payment woman according Cohen Cohen President knew false At time Trump Organization continued pay Cohens legal fee important Cohen Cohen also recalled discussing possibility pardon Presidents personal counsel told stay message everything would fine The President indicated public statement pardon ruled also stated publicly people flip Government let trouble didnt see Michael
After reported Cohen intended cooperate government however President accused Cohen making story order get unrelated jam Taxi cab maybe called Cohen rat multiple occasion publicly suggested Cohens family member committed crime The evidence concerning sequence event could support inference President used inducement form positive message effort get Cohen cooperate turned attack intimidation deter provision information undermine Cohens credibility Cohen began cooperating
b Nexus official proceeding The Presidents relevant conduct towards Cohen occurred President knew Special Counsels Office Congress US Attorneys Office Southern District New York investigating Cohens conduct The President acknowledged public statement tweet Cohen potentially could cooperate government investigation
Vol 2 Page 154
c Intent In analyzing Presidents intent action towards Cohen potential witness evidence could support inference President intended discourage Cohen cooperating government Cohens information would shed adverse light Presidents campaignperiod conduct statement
Cohens false congressional testimony Trump Tower Moscow project designed minimize connection President Russia help limit congressional DOJ Russia investigationsa goal Presidents interest reflected Presidents statement During campaign President made repeated statement business Russia said deal could happen Russia weaposve stayed away As Cohen knew recalled communicating President campaign Cohens pursuit Trump Tower Moscow project cast doubt accuracy completeness statement
In connection guilty plea Cohen admitted multiple conversation candidate Trump give status update Trump Tower Moscow project conversation continued least June 2016 discussed Trump possible travel Russia pursue project The conversation offhand according Cohen project potential lucrative In addition text message Cohen record establish Cohens effort advance project end January 2016 May June 2016 Cohen considering timing possible trip Russia Trump connection project
The evidence could support inference President aware fact time Cohens false statement Congress Cohen discussed project President early 2017 following medium inquiry Cohen recalled September 20 2017 day released public opening remark Congresswhich said project terminated January 2016the Presidents personal counsel told President pleased Cohen said Trump Tower Moscow And Cohens guilty plea President told reporter ultimately decided project support inference remained aware involvement project period Campaign project pursued
ii The Presidents public remark following Cohens guilty plea also suggest President may concerned Cohen told investigator Trump Tower Moscow project At time President submitted written answer question Office project subject medium reported Cohen cooperating government Cohen yet pleaded guilty making false statement Congress Accordingly publicly known information project Cohen provided government In written answer President provide detail timing substance discussion Cohen project gave indication decided longer pursue project Yet Cohen pleaded guilty President publicly stated personally made decision abandon project The President declined clarify seeming discrepancy Office answer additional question The content timing Presidents provision information knowledge action regarding Trump Tower Moscow project evidence President may concerned information Cohen could provide witness
Vol 2 Page 155
iii The Presidents concern Cohen cooperating may directed Southern District New York investigation aspect Presidents dealing Cohen rather investigation Trump Tower Moscow There also evidence Presidents concern Cohen cooperating based Presidents stated belief Cohen would provide false testimony President attempt obtain lesser sentence unrelated criminal conduct The President tweeted Manafort unlike Cohen refused break make story order get deal And Cohen pleaded guilty making false statement Congress President said Cohens trying get reduced sentence So he lying project everybody knew But President also appeared defend underlying conduct saying Even Cohen right doesnt matter I allowed whatever I wanted campaign As described evidence President knew Cohen made false statement Trump Tower Moscow project Cohen protect President minimize Presidents connection Russia campaign
iv Finally Presidents statement insinuating member Cohens family committed crime Cohen began cooperating government could viewed effort retaliate Cohen chill testimony adverse President Cohen others It possible President belief reflected tweet Cohen made story order get deal get wife fatherinlaw Scott Free It also possible Presidents mention Cohens wife fatherinlaw intended affect Cohen witness rather part publicrelations strategy aimed discrediting Cohen deflecting attention away President Cohenrelated matter But Presidents suggestion Cohens family member committed crime happened including Cohen sentenced time President stated Cohen opinion serve full complete sentence Cohen scheduled testify Congress The timing statement support inference intended least part discourage Cohen cooperation
Although report contain traditional prosecution decision declination decision evidence support several general conclusion relevant analysis fact concerning Presidents course conduct
1 Three feature case render atypical compared heartland obstructionofjustice prosecution brought Department Justice
First conduct involved action President Some conduct implicate Presidents constitutional authority raise gardenvariety obstructionofjustice issue Other event investigated however drew upon Presidents Article II authority raised constitutional issue address Volume II Section IIIB infra A factual analysis conduct would take account Presidents act facially lawful position head Executive Branch provides unique powerful mean influencing official proceeding subordinate officer potential witness
Vol 2 Page 156
Second many obstruction case involve attempted actual coverup underlying crime Personal criminal conduct furnish strong evidence individual improper obstructive purpose see eg United States v Willoughby 860 F2d 15 24 2d Cir 1988 contemplated effect official proceeding see eg United States v Binday 804 F3d 558 591 2d Cir 2015 But proof crime element obstruction offense See United States v Greer 872 F3d 790 798 6th Cir 2017 stating applying obstruction sentencing guideline obstruction criminal investigation punishable even prosecution ultimately unsuccessful even investigation ultimately reveals underlying crime Obstruction justice motivated desire protect noncriminal personal interest protect investigation underlying criminal liability fall gray area avoid personal embarrassment The injury integrity justice system regardless whether person committed underlying wrong
In investigation evidence establish President involved underlying crime related Russian election interference But evidence point range possible personal motif animating Presidents conduct These include concern continued investigation would call question legitimacy election potential uncertainty whether certain eventssuch advance notice WikiLeakss release hacked information June 9 2016 meeting senior campaign official Russianscould seen criminal activity President campaign family
Third many Presidents act directed witness including discouragement cooperation government suggestion possible future pardon occurred public view While may difficult establish publicfacing act motivated corrupt intent Presidents power influence action person event enhanced unique ability attract attention use mass communication And principle law excludes public act scope obstruction statute If likely effect act intimidate witness alter testimony justice system integrity equally threatened
2 Although event investigated involved discrete actseg Presidents statement Comey Flynn investigation termination Comey effort remove Special Counselit important view Presidents pattern conduct whole That pattern shed light nature Presidents act inference drawn intent
Our investigation found multiple act President capable exerting undue influence law enforcement investigation including Russianinterference obstruction investigation The incident often carried oneonone meeting President sought use official power outside usual channel These action ranged effort remove Special Counsel reverse effect Attorney Generals recusal attempted use official power limit scope investigation direct indirect contact witness potential influence testimony Viewing act collectively help illuminate significance1 For example Presidents direction McGahn Special Counsel removed followed almost immediately direction Lewandowski tell Attorney General limit scope Russia investigation prospective electioninterference onlya temporal connection suggests act taken related purpose respect investigation
Vol 2 Page 157
The Presidents effort influence investigation mostly unsuccessful largely person surrounded President declined carry order accede request Comey end investigation Flynn ultimately resulted Flynns prosecution conviction lying FBI McGahn tell Acting Attorney General Special Counsel must removed instead prepared resign Presidents order Lewandowski Dearborn deliver Presidents message Sessions confine Russia investigation future election meddling And McGahn refused recede recollection event surrounding Presidents direction Special Counsel removed despite Presidents multiple demand Consistent pattern evidence obtained would support potential obstruction charge Presidents aide associate beyond already filed
b In considering full scope conduct investigated Presidents action divided two distinct phase reflecting possible shift Presidents motif In first phase President fired Comey President assured FBI opened investigation personally The President deemed critically important make public investigation included information termination letter Comey effort information disclosed unsuccessful
Soon fired Comey however President became aware investigator conducting obstructionofjustice inquiry conduct That awareness marked significant change Presidents conduct start second phase action The President launched public attack investigation individual involved could posse evidence adverse President private President engaged series targeted effort control investigation For instance President attempted remove Special Counsel sought Attorney General Sessions unrecuse limit investigation sought prevent public disclosure information June 9 2016 meeting Russians campaign official used public forum attack potential witness might offer adverse information praise witness declined cooperate government Judgments nature Presidents motif phase would informed totality evidence
Vol 2 Page 158
The Presidents personal counsel written Office advance statutory constitutional defense potential application obstructionofjustice statute Presidents conduct1072 As statutory matter Presidents counsel argued core obstructionofjustice statute 18 USC 1512c2 cover Presidents actions1073 As constitutional matter Presidents counsel argued President obstruct justice exercising constitutional authority close Department Justice investigation terminate FBI Director1074 Under view statute restricts Presidents exercise power would impermissibly intrude Presidents constitutional role The Presidents counsel conceded President may subject criminal law directly involve exercise Article II authority law prohibiting bribing witness suborning perjury1075 But counsel made categorical argument Presidents exercise constitutional authority terminate FBI Director close investigation constitutionally constitute obstruction justice1076
In analyzing counsel statutory argument concluded Presidents proposed interpretation Section 1512c2 contrary litigating position Department Justice supported principle statutory construction
As constitutional argument recognized Department Justice court definitively resolved constitutional issue We therefore analyzed Presidents position framework Supreme Court precedent addressing separation power Under framework concluded Article II Constitution categorically permanently immunize President potential liability conduct investigated Rather analysis led u conclude obstructionofjustice statute

The Department Justice taken position Section 1512c2 state broad independent unqualified prohibition obstruction justice1077 While defendant argued subsection c2 read cover act would impair availability integrity evidence subsection c1s focus strong argument weigh proposed limitation The text Section 1512c2 confirms sweep tethered Section 1512c1 court interpreted history counsel otherwise principle statutory construction dictate contrary view On face therefore Section 1512c2 applies corrupt mean obstructing proceeding pending contemplatedincluding improper exercise official power In addition statutory provision potentially applicable certain conduct investigated broadly prohibit obstruction proceeding pending court grand jury Congress See 18 USC 1503 1505 Congress also specifically prohibited witness tampering See 18 USC 1512b

c Finally rule lenity justify treating Section 1512c2 prohibition evidence impairment opposed omnibus clause The rule lenity interpretive principle resolve ambiguity criminal law favor lesssevere construction Cleveland v United States 531 US 12 25 2000 As Court repeatedly emphasized however rule lenity applies considering text structure history purpose remains grievous ambiguity uncertainty statute Court must simply guess Congress intended Abramski v United States 573 US 169 188 n10 2014 internal quotation mark omitted The rule cited example adopting narrow meaning tangible object obstruction statute prohibition title history list prohibited act indicated focus destruction record See Yates v United States 135 S Ct 1074 1088 2015 plurality opinion interpreting tangible object phrase record document tangible object 18 USC 1519 mean item capable recording preserving information Here discussed text structure history Section 1512c2 leaf grievous ambiguity statute meaning Section 1512c2 defines structurally independent general prohibition obstruction official proceeding
Regardless whether Section 1512C2 cover corrupt act obstruct influence impede pending contemplated proceeding statute would apply conduct pending proceeding provided remaining statutory element satisfied As discussed omnibus clause 18 USC 1503a applies generally obstruction pending judicial grand proceedings1084 See Aguilar 515 US 598 noting clause far general scope preceding provision Section 1503as protection extend witness tampering obstructive conduct nexus pending proceeding See Sampson 898 F3d 298303 n6 collecting case eight circuit holding Section 1503 cover witnessrelated obstructive conduct cabining prior circuit authority And Section 1505 broadly criminalizes obstructive conduct aimed pending agency congressional proceedings1085 See eg United States v Rainey 757 F3d 234 241247 5th Cir 2014

Finally 18 USC 1512b3 criminalizes tampering witness prevent communication information crime law enforcement The nexus inquiry articulated Aguilarthat individual knowledge action likely affect judicial proceeding 515 US 599does apply Section 1512b3 See United States v Byrne 435 F3d 16 2425 1st Cir 2006 The nexus inquiry turn instead actor intent prevent communication federal law enforcement official See Fowler v United States 563 US 668 673678 2011

In sum light breadth Section 1512c2 obstruction statute argument conduct issue investigation fall outside scope obstruction law lack merit
The President broad discretion direct criminal investigation The Constitution vest executive Power President enjoins take Care Laws faithfully executed US CONST ART II 1 3 Those power duty form foundation prosecutorial discretion See United States v Armstrong 517 US 456 464 1996 Attorney General United States Attorneys latitude designated statute Presidents delegate help discharge constitutional responsibility take Care Laws faithfully executed The President also authority appoint officer United States remove appointed US CONST ART II 2 cl 2 granting authority President appoint officer advice consent Senate providing Congress may vest appointment inferior officer President alone head department court law see also Free Enterprise Fund v Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 561 US 477 492493 509 2010 describing removal authority flowing Presidents responsibility take care law faithfully executed
Although President broad authority Article II authority coexists Congresss Article I power enact law protect congressional proceeding federal investigation court grand jury corrupt effort undermine function Usually constitutional power function harmony President enforcing criminal law Article II protect corrupt obstructive act But Presidents official action come conflict prohibition obstruction statute constitutional tension reconciled separationofpowers analysis

relevant criminal trial would cut deeply guarantee due process law gravely impair basic function court 407 US 712 As Nixon illustrates need safeguard judicial integrity compelling constitutional interest See id 709 noting denial full disclosure fact surrounding relevant presidential communication threatens integrity judicial system public confidence system
iii Finally grand jury achieve constitutional purpose absent protection corrupt act Serious federal criminal charge generally reach Article III court based indictment issued grand jury Cobbledick v United States 309 US 323 327 1940 The Constitution make grand jury part judicial process And grand jury function enshrined Fifth Amendment US CONST AMEND V person shall held answer serious crime unless presentment indictment Grand Jury The whole theory grand jury function belongs branch institutional government serving kind buffer referee Government people United States v Williams 504 US 36 47 1992 pledged indict one prejudice free one special favor Costello v United States 350 US 359 362 1956 If grand jury protected corrupt interference person function independent charging body would thwarted And impartial grand jury investigation determine whether probable cause exists indict vital criminal justice process

The final step constitutional balancing process ass whether separation ofpowers doctrine permit Congress take action within constitutional authority notwithstanding potential impact Article Il function See Administrator General Services 433 US 443 see also Morrison 487 US 691693 695696 United States v Nixon 418 US 711712 In case obstructionofjustice statute assessment weighing interest lead u conclude Congress authority impose limited restriction contained statute Presidents official conduct protect integrity important function branch government
A general ban corrupt action unduly intrude Presidents responsibility take Care Laws faithfully executed US CONST ART II 31090 To contrary concept faithful execution connotes use power interest public office holder personal interest See 1 Samuel Johnson A Dictionary English Language 763 1755 faithfully def 3 strict adherence duty allegiance And immunizing President generally applicable criminal prohibition corrupt obstruction official proceeding would seriously impair Congresss power enact law promote objective within constitutional authority Administrator General Services 433 US 425ie protecting integrity proceeding proceeding Article III court grand jury
1090 As noted Presidents selection removal principal executive officer may unique constitutional status
Vol 2 Page 177
Accordingly based analysis persuaded argument President blanket constitutional immunity engage act would corruptly obstruct justice exercise otherwisevalid Article II powers1091
Applying obstruction statute Presidents official conduct would involve determining factual matter whether engaged obstructive act whether act nexus official proceeding whether motivated corrupt intent But applying standard Presidents official conduct hinder ability perform Article II duty Cf Nixon v Fitzgerald 457 US 752753 n32 taking account chilling effect President adopting constitutional rule presidential immunity private civil damage action based official duty Several safeguard would prevent chilling effect existence settled legal standard presumption regularity prosecutorial action existence evidentiary limitation probing Presidents motif And historical experience confirms impermissible chill exist
As initial matter term corruptly set demanding standard It requires concrete showing person acted intent obtain improper advantage someone else inconsistent official duty right others BALLENTINES LAW DICTIONARY 276 3d ed 1969 see United States v Pasha 797 F3d 1122 1132 DC Cir 2015 Aguilar 515 US 616 Scalia J concurring part dissenting part That standard parallel Presidents constitutional obligation ensure faithful execution law And virtually everything President routine conduct office clear governmental purpose contrary official duty Accordingly President reason chilled action virtually instance credible basis suspecting corrupt personal motive
That point illustrated example conduct would would satisfy stringent corruptmotive standard Direct indirect action President end criminal investigation family member conduct protect personal embarrassment legal liability would constitute core example corruptly motivated conduct So would action halt enforcement proceeding directly adversely affected Presidents financial interest purpose protecting interest In example
1091 A possible remedy impeachment abuse power would substitute potential criminal liability President leaf office Impeachment would remove President office would address underlying culpability conduct serve usual purpose criminal law Indeed Impeachment Judgment Clause recognizes criminal law play independent role addressing official conduct distinct political remedy impeachment See US CONST ART I 3 cl 7 Impeachment also drastic rarely invoked remedy Congress restricted relying impeachment rather making criminal law applicable former President OLC recognized A Sitting Presidents Amenability Indictment Criminal Prosecution 24 Op OLC 255 Recognizing immunity prosecution sitting President would preclude prosecution Presidents term otherwise removed office resignation impeachment
Vol 2 Page 178
official power used purpose protecting Presidents personal interest In contrast Presidents action serve political policy interest would qualify corrupt The Presidents role head government necessarily requires take account political factor making policy decision affect lawenforcement action proceeding For instance Presidents decision curtail lawenforcement investigation avoid international friction would implicate obstructionofjustice statute The criminal law seek regulate consideration political policy factor conduct government And legitimate interest animate Presidents conduct interest almost invariably readily identifiable based objective factor Because Presidents conduct instance obviously fall outside zone obstruction law chilling concern arise
b There also reason believe investigation let alone prosecution would occur except highly unusual circumstance credible factual basis exists believe obstruction occurred Prosecutorial action enjoys presumption regularity absent clear evidence contrary court presume prosecutor properly discharged official duty Armstrong 517 US 464 quoting United States v Chemical Foundation Inc 272 US 1 1415 1926 The presumption prosecutorial regularity would provide even greater protection President exists routine case given prominence sensitivity matter involving President likelihood matter subject thorough careful review senior level Department Justice Under OLCs opinion sitting President entitled immunity indictment successor Administration would able prosecute former President But consideration suggest President would basis fearing abusive investigation prosecution leaving office There obvious political check initiating baseless investigation prosecution former President See Administrator General Services 433 US 448 considering political check separationofpowers analysis And Attorney General hold power conduct criminal litigation United States Government United States v Nixon 418 US 694 citing 28 USC 516 provides strong institutional safeguard politicized investigation prosecution 1092
1092 Similar institutional safeguard protect Department Justice officer line prosecutor unfounded investigation prosecutorial act Prosecutors generally barred participating matter implicating personal interest see 28 CFR 452 instructed influenced professional personal circumstance Justice Manual 927260 prosecutor would frequently position take action could perceived corrupt personally motivated And case arise criminal investigation would conducted responsible official Department Justice presumed refrain pursuing investigation absent credible factual basis Those fact distinguish criminal context commonlaw rule prosecutorial immunity protects threat suit defendant often transform resentment prosecuted ascription improper malicious action Imbler v Pachtman 424 US 409 425 1976 As Supreme Court noted existence civil immunity justify criminal immunity See Oshea v Littleton 414 US 488 503 1974 Whatever may case respect civil liability generally never held performance duty judicial legislative executive officer requires contemplates immunization otherwise criminal deprivation constitutional right citation omitted
Vol 2 Page 179
These consideration distinguish Supreme Courts holding Nixon v Fitzgerald part inquiry Presidents motif would highly intrusive President absolutely immune private civil damage action based official conduct 457 US 756757 As Fitzgerald recognized lesser public interest action civil damage example criminal prosecution Fitzgerald 457 US 754 n37 see Cheney 542 US 384 And private action subject institutional protection action supervision Attorney General subject presumption regularity Armstrong 517 US 464
c In rare case substantial credible basis justifies conducting investigation President process examining motivation determine whether acted corrupt purpose need chilling effect Ascertaining Presidents motivation would turn explanation provided justify action advice received circumstance surrounding action regularity irregularity process employed make decision But grand jury court would automatic access confidential presidential communication matter rather could presented official proceeding showing sufficient need Nixon 418 US 712 In Sealed Case 121 F3d 729 754 756757 DC Cir 1997 see also Administrator General Services 433 US 448449 former President invoke presidential communication privilege although successor failure support claim detracts weight
In event probing Presidents intent criminal matter unquestionably constitutional least one context offense bribery turn corrupt intent receive thing value return influenced official action 18 USC 201b2 There serious argument Presidents potential criminal liability bribery offense notwithstanding need ascertain purpose intent See US CONST ART I 3 ART II 4 see also Application 28 USC 458 Presidential Appointments Federal Judges 19 Op OLC 357 n11 Application 201to President raise separation power issue let alone serious one
Finally history provides reason believe asserted chilling effect justifies exempting President obstruction law As historical matter Presidents seldom subject grand jury investigation And rarer still circumstance raise even possibility corrupt personal motive arguably obstructive action Presidents use official power Accordingly Presidents conduct office chilled based hypothetical concern possible application corruptmotive standard context

In sum contrary position taken Presidents counsel concluded light Supreme Court precedent governing separationofpowers issue valid basis investigating conduct issue report In view application obstruction statute would impermissibly burden Presidents performance Article II function supervise prosecutorial conduct remove inferior lawenforcement officer And protection criminal justice system corrupt act personincluding Presidentaccords fundamental principle government person

Because determined make traditional prosecutorial judgment draw ultimate conclusion Presidents conduct The evidence obtained Presidents action intent present difficult issue would need resolved making traditional prosecutorial judgment At time confidence thorough investigation fact President clearly commit obstruction justice would state1 Based fact applicable legal standard unable reach judgment Accordingly report conclude President committed crime also exonerate
