During over 20 years within the golf industry I have read scores of articles analyzing golfs lack of growth. I have also witnessed countless programs designed solely to recruit new players of every age and demographic. The one constant is that all of the effort and money is being expended by those who have a vested interested in the game; primarily a financial interest. It’s certainly not hard to understand why equipment makers, golf retailers and course owners have been the driving force and why they might be puzzled by how little their efforts seem to be paying off. One culprit may well be our insistence upon viewing the issue from top down. While the keepers and merchants of the game debate what might be wrong, how they should address the problems and what results they expect; no one is making an in depth effort to find out how prospective and current players really see golf.																								
I would argue that for the average person considering the game, golf has an exclusionary, stodgy and elitist aura about it. We in the industry and especially those who consider themselves to be the caretakers of golfs legacy, have to try and look at this through the eyes of a newcomer. The pool of potential young players we could draw from are accustomed to activities that provide immediate gratification, sports that feature raucous crowd involvement (like the par 3 out in Phoenix or any NFL, NBA or NHL game) and an inclusive vibe. In general golf is really none of these and I would offer the recently concluded Masters as a case in point. The quiet traditional reverence that pervades one of golf’s biggest showcases sits well with purists and most current players but could easily come across as elitist and intimidating to others. Consider the Masters recently modified ban on female members and of course the fact that golfs oldest ruling body, the Royal & Ancient Club, has never had a female member. The defense is always that they are private organizations and have a right to decide who they want as members. This may be technically correct but from an image standpoint it reinforces the notion that golf is exclusionary by design and a fraternity not open to all.																								
Imagine how a non-golfer would view the discussion of the anchored club rule. Most of the commentary tends to be long winded, technical and delivered with the passion of your average PowerPoint presentation. The idea of having a comment period while never intending to seriously consider dissenting views (even from other ruling bodies) shows the inflexibility the game is famous for. I can’t remember any other major sport handling a proposed rule change in this fashion and I would never expect any sport but golf to use a term like bifurcation (when two sets of rules would do) to add to the atmosphere of self-importance. Mind you there is no need to “Happy Gilmore” the game in an attempt to widen its appeal but we should at least ask if golf is making a serious effort at inclusion or just taking itself too seriously.

Any avid golfer who watches The Golf Channel has likely seen hundreds, if not thousands of golf infomercials. They’re all quite similar – a spokesman who has 1-2 PGA Tour wins promises to fix your golf game, mid to high handicappers are shown with their swings magically being fixed, and they all seem to take place in Arizona with the mountains as a backdrop.

Their claims are ridiculous, and the product designs are even more laughable. But the truth is that there are tons of golfers buying them. Why do you think they keep purchasing advertising space? It works!

After years of seeing the same products over and over again, I decided I should do the golfing public a solid and test many of them out. So I racked up some charges on my credit card and ordered some of the usual suspects:

GX-7 Metal
Supersonic X10
C3i Wedge
B1 Blue Strike
Square Strike Wedge
I gave all of them a fair shake and tested them out. In this article, I’ll explore how each product performs against its claims, and whether or not any of them are worth purchasing."

https://www.hittingthegreen.com/how-to-address-a-golf-ball-with-a-driver,"You’re on the tee, maybe the first hole, your playing partners are watching, the group behind are watching. Despite all the attention, it is essential that you’re relaxed when you address the ball. This can only come from practice and confidence, your state of mind. Remember you’re among friends, your buddies don’t want you to mess up your drive – they are right behind you. Goodness, they are next up! So, get rid of all those negative thoughts, put them out of your mind, focus on the ball and relax.

Ball position

Ball position, not too far forward, inside left heel, shaft position, not forward, not back. The position of the ball will vary depending on which club you are using but for the driver the accepted ball position is inside the left heel (for right handers). The general rule is, the longer the club, the further forward you place the ball.

Coupled with this is the position of the shaft. If the club shaft is leaning forward, you will effectively lower the loft of the club. Not good. If the club shaft is leaning back, you will increase the loft. Not what you want. Keep the club shaft in a neutral upright position in relation to the ball position. Maintain the loft of the club you are using.

A good tip is, address the ball as normal with your driver, then let go of the club. It should make contact with the inside of your left thigh (again, for right handers). In fact, this tip applies to all the clubs in your bag.

Distance from the ball

Standing too far from the ball or too near, will affect your golf swing. It is important to be standing the correct distance from the ball. Since club lengths differ, your distance from the ball will depend on which club you are using.

Every club is designed with a lie angle. Rest the club on the ground so that the bottom of the club is lying evenly, not tilting forward or back. This action will determine the distance you should be standing from the ball."
http://blog.golfnow.com/best-value-golf-courses-in-chicago/,"Chicago, like any big city, can be pricey. It doesn’t matter where you go for entertainment – out to eat, to watch a game, exploring a museum – every experience can feel expensive. Fortunately, playing golf doesn’t have to be that way. The game offers a variety of courses that can make it affordable for anybody to play. Chicago has its share of fancy private clubs – Shoreacres, Butler National, Black Sheep, Chicago Golf Club, Cog Hill, The Glen Club, etc. They’re all great experiences and special treats once in a while.
 
But the majority of golfers want value, feeling like they’re recreational dollars go a little further. That’s where dozens of lesser known – but perfectly able and enjoyable – courses fit the bill. Municipal golf – which offers some of the best value golf courses in Chicago – is a good place to start. Many suburbs within driving distance of downtown offer something for residents and better rates for the general public. The Forest Preserve courses of Cook County tend to be shorter and easier, important traits of some of the best value golf courses in Chicago. Although located within the city limits, the 6,028-yard Indian Boundary Golf Course still has that natural feel with deer roaming the fairways. The Chick Evans Golf Course in Morton Grove is even shorter (5,691 yards). The Chicago River flows through its midsection. Golfers can rent GolfBoards at both courses to spice up their round.
 
Golfers should play their final rounds at Jackson Park Golf Course on the south side before it disappears. Jackson Park, owned by the Chicago Park District, is on track to rebuilt into a new Tiger Woods design by 2021-22 that could eventually host the PGA Tour. Its lakefront setting is good now but will be better put to use by the eventual rerouting.
 
The Bonnie Brook Golf Course in Waukegan was designed in 1926 by James Foulis, who won the second U.S. Open in 1896.  The course called “The Brook” by locals has a classic feel accented by gently rolling hills, tall native grasses, sparkling lakes and the north branch of the Waukegan River.  In 2014, local architect Dave Esler transformed the 6,300-yard, par-70 Mt. Prospect Golf Club into a smorgasbord of Golden Age architecture with template holes featuring Redan, Biarritz, Double Plateau and Punchbowl greens.
 
Another architectural dream is the 6,430-yard Kankakee Elks Country Club, set upon the banks of Kankakee River in Saint Anne south of the city. Golden Age architects William Langford and Theodore Moreau, best known for their work at the Links of Lawsonia in Wisconsin, built similar bold features here.
 
Keith Foster has contributed his share of best value golf courses to greater Chicago. Shepherd’s Crook Golf Course in Zion gets great reviews on Golf Advisor for its linksy architecture and value. The Highlands of Elgin Golf Course, built atop a defunct course, showcases nine new holes around an old stone quarry. Four holes hug the top of the bluff, providing nice views and good shot values.
 
Last but not least, the Oak Grove Golf Course in Harvard occupies natural land used by a former hunt club and is considered one of the best value golf courses in Chicago."
https://mygolfspy.com/callaway-play-yellow-erc-golf-ball/,"In 1986 Jack Nicklaus captured a record 6th green jacket by dramatically winning The Masters and while Augusta’s iconic blazer has a firmly etched place in golf history, it was Jack’s yellow shirt which has come to symbolize the philanthropic efforts spearheaded by Jack and Barbara on behalf of Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals. Jack routinely donned a yellow polo during final rounds in memory of Craig Smith, the son of a close family friend who passed away in 1971 at the age of 13 from a rare form of bone cancer.

Now with the support of the PGA Tour and various corporate sponsors, Jack and Barbara have set a goal to raise $100 million over the next five years to help fund pediatric health care. Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals rely on donations to help cover treatment costs beyond what many insurance plans provide.

It’s a cause which the Nicklaus family has supported for years in Ohio and Florida, and the Play Yellow campaign looks to extend this philanthropic effort across North America.

For its part, Callaway is donating $4 for every dozen-pack of Callaway ERC Soft Yellow balls sold from April 19th-May 31st. ERC Soft is the longest “soft” ball in Callaway’s line up and features Triple Track Technology for better alignment and a yellow colorway for enhanced visibility. The total amount raised during this quarter will be announced at The Memorial tournament (May 30-June 2), which is held at Muirfield Village Golf Club (aka Jack’s place) in Dublin, Ohio."

Direction (line)
Distance control (speed)
There’s no question that golfers need to possess both these skills, but contrary to popular belief, they are not equally important on all putts. Sometimes, speed should be the primary concern. In other situations, golfers should be focused almost entirely on line. To make this determination, we have to consider the distance range of a putt and a golfer’s putting skill.

In the above referenced article, I showed how important speed is in putting, as well as the distances from which golfers of each handicap level should become more focused on speed.

http://armchairgolfblog.blogspot.com,"JUPITER, Fla.) – The National Golf Foundation (NGF), the only trade organization that works with every sector within the golf industry, has released its 2019 Golf Industry Report, a comprehensive state-of-the-industry overview.

The Golf Industry Report (GIR) compiles many of the game's key data points in a single publication and is intended to provide the most holistic view of the business of golf and the health of the game within the U.S. to stakeholders and the media. The GIR includes the latest NGF data on golf participation, engagement, rounds-played, latent demand, golf course supply and development, retail supply, golf equipment sales, and golf’s reach.

Golf's participation base remains stable, with an estimated 24.2 million people (ages 6+) who played golf on a course in 2018 — a slight increase from 23.8 million a year earlier.

Almost as many people play off-course forms of the game, with 23 million hitting golf balls with clubs at golf-entertainment facilities like Topgolf and Drive Shack, indoor simulators and driving ranges. With 9.3 million people exclusively playing golf off-course, the game's overall participant pool has increased 4% to 33.5 million.

There were 434 million rounds of golf played in 2018, a 4.8% year-over-year decline attributable in part to the third-wettest year on record nationally dating back to 1895 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association).

http://golfstinks.com/blog/2010/10/truth-about-walking-golf-course.html#.XLtsli-ZPBI,"Now I realize if you walk the golf course, there’s no place to put your beer. I get it. I’ve been guilty of using the cart as a portable keg too.

It’s so much easier to ride out there – no long walks between tees; no feeling like a mountain goat; no fatigue over the last few holes.

Besides, when your doctor tells you to get more exercise, he doesn’t mean to go play golf – at least my doctor didn’t: “Golf is stop-and-go, Greg. You don’t get enough of a workout walking a little, stopping to hit a ball and then walking a little more.”

But golfing has got to count for something, doesn’t it? We’ve posed this question before, in this post, a while ago. But now we actually have some proof that walking the golf course is not only healthy, but it’s also a good way to get some exercise.

A published study entitled “Physical Activity Parameters for Walking Golf Participation: An Analysis of Volume and Intensity” from Mark D. Peterson (Department of Exercise and Wellness at Arizona State University) has provided us some interesting findings.

Mr. Peterson set-out to prove that the volume and intensity of activity while walking 18-holes could be pinpointed by using modern technology. He began by recruiting healthy men between 18 and 30 years of age at a local, average-sized (6,"
https://www.thegolfblog.com,"Chamblee and Shipnuck aren’t the only golf analysts or reporters who doubted Tiger Woods or the coverage he received. There are plenty other people who get paid good money to comment or report on golf who doubted Tiger, too. Some even “hated” on Tiger.
But why? Each analyst or reporter might be different, but it’s worth raising the question today–after Tiger won his fifth Masters following near misses at the PGA Championship and The Open Championship in 2018–why did some professional golf analysts and reporters hold so much doubt that Tiger Woods could win a major again? Sure, Tiger had a major dry spell, injuries, surgeries, and a brief bout with the chip yips along with aging, all of which would at least raise the question whether Tiger could win. We certainly asked the question. On the other hand, as a professional analyst or reporter, you’ve got to gather all facts, interview experts who may know more than you, and, most importantly, consider the other side. In other words, try to be objective because you might not have all the information–or, even worse, you might hold an implicit bias against Tiger you are simply not aware of.
And another thing. If you were one of the reporters or analysts who doubted Tiger Woods, don’t sit here today and act like “we all felt the same way” or “I’m so happy to see Tiger win.” Chamblee, you know what we mean. Do some of your own self-reflection as a professional analyst or reporter. Try to improve your reporting and coverage to be more objective and accurate."

This trio of cultural icons has characterised Scotland since time immemorial. However, if you talk to any fan of the famous club and ball game, they’ll be quick to tell you there’s an important omission here. And they’d be right. Golf is as synonymous with Scotland as the mysterious monster that supposedly inhabits the loch, and fits in as well with the country folk as a ladleful of “tattie scones” in a Scottish breakfast.

Home to some of the greatest courses on the planet, Scotland belongs on any travelling golfer’s bucket list. I start my series of exclusive Golf & Travel guides to Scotlands Open venues with a look at the seminal venue – St Andrews.

It’s not a long course and each hole is different from each other, and different from the previous day. The wind has a huge effect on the course as it should with a links course. The views across Carmarthen Bay and the monastic Caldey Island are spectacular. The course uses the features of the area in a fascinating contest that echoes the original golfing layouts of Scotland. It especially echoes the course at Prestwick, the setting for the first Open Competition. It can be tough, but always fair.

However, it was as a course designer that he felt his great passion and designed over 200 golf courses in Britain including Championship courses at Carnoustie, Troon, and Prestwick. He worked on 20 courses in Wales. He was prolific and worked the same way. He kept the greens committee happy by charging a low fee and communicating his ideas quickly and effectively."

http://armchairgolfblog.blogspot.com,"I WAS DRIVING EASTBOUND ON I-64 during the final round of the 2019 Masters. I had attended my aunt's funeral in southern Indiana. Now my wife and I were heading home to Virginia after a difficult and emotional week for our family.


Somewhere east of Louisville my cousin called.

""Hey, are you watching the Masters?""

My wife and I laughed. Yes, we are.

I had the live stream on my phone perched between us on the console. I could easily listen to Jim Nantz and others describe the action as the contenders navigated Amen Corner and the finishing holes. But it was hard to watch the Masters while I drove the interstate. I tried, though, stealing glances at a putt, a tee shot, a pitch. My wife kept telling me to watch the road. I am, I am, I said.

As Tiger Woods later said in Butler Cabin, the leaderboard flipped at the tricky par-3 12th hole when four of five players, including Brooks Koepka and Francesco Molinari, hit their tee shots into the water. Through patience and experience, Tiger jumped to the top of the leaderboard and went on to win his fifth Masters and 15th major championship.

For the first time Woods won a major by coming from behind, and his fifth Green Jacket represented the longest victory gap in Masters history. Tiger's comeback has astonished nearly everyone, including himself.

While I was eating a late lunch in Lexington, Kentucky, my brother-in-law phoned from Seattle. He expressed condolences and then mentioned the Masters. Yes, I knew what happened. Now the Internet is going to blow up, I joked.

Late that afternoon, after checking into a hotel, I was able to watch the last two hours of the encore broadcast of the final round. I saw the historic drama unfold shot by shot.

The images that stood out for me were at the finish, when Tiger tapped in on 18 and raised his arms and soon after beamed in Butler Cabin. His face said it all, covered with expressions of pure joy and an unabashed smile that reminded me of that 21-year-old kid who shook this same glorious ground in 1997.

Tiger has been carrying a lot of pain for a long time, and not only in his back or his knee or his Achilles tendon. Just like he was lauded like no other when he was on top of the world, he was kicked like no other when he was down.

Maybe Tiger will win more majors. Maybe he'll catch and pass Jack Nicklaus, who has 18.

Whatever happens, it's hard for me to imagine a more important and redemptive victory for Tiger Woods. Nearly everyone is cheering once again. The pain has turned to sheer joy."

Media Release

Scott will headline the ISPS HANDA PGA Tour of Australasia and European Tour co-sanctioned tournament which will be played from 19-22 December at RACV Royal Pines Resort on the Gold Coast.

“I am really looking forward to playing in the Australian PGA Championship and ending my year at such a fun tournament,” said Scott.

“I love coming home and playing in front of Aussie crowds and they don’t get much better than at the Australian PGA Championship. The fans really embrace all of the players and help us celebrate the end of the season.”

“To be able to win another Joe Kirkwood Cup would be the perfect end to 2019,” added Scott who won the 2013 Australian PGA Championship.

While still early in 2019, Scott has made a solid start to the PGA TOUR season recording three top-10 results, including a runner-up finish at the Farmers Insurance Open in just eight starts this year.

“At the end of last season I had to make a tough decision to skip the Australian summer of golf in order to give myself the best opportunity to prepare for 2019,” said Scott.

http://sirshanksalot.com/short-putt-yip-fix/,"After suffering from the yips over the past few years, you learn to try different techniques and strategies in your on-going hope to find a cure. To-date, I still suffer from the yips on occasion but have found a few solutions that simply takes my brain out of the equation so that the stroke becomes less about feel, and more mechanical. Aside from drinking a few brews on the course, this tip is one that I feel could help many golfers out there.  Here’s how it’s done:

For me personally, I was finding that my yip occurred on the follow-through of my stroke.  It would be a jerky transition from the backswing into the follow-through, with an abruptly finishing stroke right after impact. It was embarrassing to putt in front of my peers.. and even worse, I could often feel if my setup was going to trigger a ‘yip’ just by how it felt standing over the ball. This got me thinking.  All I needed to do was ‘take my head’ out of the equation on the follow-through, and I should be able to finish the stroke more consistently than before. I started to think about how to best do this.  Here’s what I tried.

Eyes Closed

This tactic is actually very effective for shorter putts, but unfortunately, without the visual cues, I often screwed up this tactic as well.  Learning to be comfortable and putting with your eyes closed is very difficult and often requires more brain power than just regular putting all together. So I tried this next, much more successful option.

Eyes Looking At The Hole

This strategy worked well – and Jordan Spieth would agree with us.  I was able to get the visual cues and felt comfortable over the ball open setup, and then rather than returning my eyes to the ball right before my stroke, I kept them trained on the hole. For short putts, this worked like a charm, for longer putts, I struggled a bit with my weight and feel – but at least my putts were on line. Over time though, I was able to become much more consistent with this technique and avoided yipping (for the most part) by removing my visual cues over the ball for the stroke (where my yip originated).

https://www.americangolf.com/blog/golf-tips/does-mini-golf-help-your-putting/,"If you’re a confident golfer, you might be tempted to challenge your friends to a round of putt putt golf. Golfers are great at putt putt, right? You might even begin to wonder – can playing mini golf make you an even better putter?

Mini golf is a popular pastime for many people who have never even picked up a golf club. That doesn’t mean they can sink their ball in one stroke the first time they play on a course. The skills are not exactly parallel. In fact, some golfers might worry that playing can harm their golf game.

How it Hurts

While it seems like good practice, the conditions on a putt putt course are very different from real greens. The speed of fake grass is nothing like actual grass. Don’t be surprised if real putting makes your mini game worse, and vice versa.

In addition, your putter at home will be significantly better quality than the mass-made cheap neon putters used in putt putt. Your putter and the mini golf club are weighted very differently. You’ll have to make some adjustments when you switch between them.

Also note the putt putt balls are not Titleists, or anything close.

To combat these issues, do some practice putts on the practice greens at the course before you play 9 or 18 holes. You should reset your swing to be for your club and for the real grass.

How it Helps

While you might need to make some adjustments to your swing when you switch between golfs, mini golf can teach you some valuable skills that you can apply to your course game.

Playing mini golf requires a lot of strategy, mainly in analyzing the slope of the putt putt course and the obstacles. This can assist you in analyzing the s"

THE MASTERS 1988 – SANDY LYLE
With a Brit yet to don a green jacket, Sandy Lyle was tied with Mark Calcavecchia on the 18th hole. His drive landed him in one of Augusta’s famous fairway bunkers, making for a nervous approach.

https://break80.guide/2019/03/slow-your-downswing-boost-your-distance/,"Transitioning from the top makes your downswing. Start down well, and you won’t have to make an adjustment to save your swing. Plus, you’ll supercharge your power and generate more distance. Hitting a short pitch to the green beats a long approach shot every time:
 
Plant that heel — The key to making a good downswing is to start from the ground up. Stamping your front heel helps you do that. It ignites a sound, ground-up sequence that moves you to the downswing. It also smooths out a too-quick transition. It’s a good approach if you tend to shift forward during your swing.
 
Fire your hips — Many savvy golfers—weekend or otherwise—make this move. It overrides a lack of power, loss of balance, and “handsey” release. It also prevents falling back on the downswing and sliding laterally instead of unwinding. More importantly, it lets you compress the ball. The move is good for backs, too.
 
Drop your arms — Some golfers call this the magic move. Whether it’s magic or not, you decide. But it goes this way: Start by moving your arms in front of your chest, tuck your back elbow into your side, then take an inside track to the ball.
 
The move helps you achieve an in-to-out swing path, increase swing speed, and stops you from throwing your right shoulder toward the ball—a key cause of coming over the top. If you hit slices, pulls, popups, deep divots with your irons, this move helps."

Keep Limited Golf Mobility from Hurting Your Distance

Do you struggle with mobility in your golf swing?

No matter how fit we may be, we’re all bound to eventually lose some of our flexibility and range of motion. It could be the result of an injury. Or, as in my case, it could just be the side effect of getting older.

If you’ve lost some of your mobility and your swing is suffering because of it, don’t worry. A lot of golfers come to my lesson tee with the same problem, and there’s always a solution. Whether your golf swing has gotten stiffer due to injury or due to age, I can help.



I’m going to share three simple tricks to help you rediscover your old mobility and start hitting the ball farther. And in case those don’t help, I’ll also share one (slightly unorthodox) bonus tip that could still save your swing.

First, let’s clarify the underlying concept that explains why these tips work.

The Key to Golf Mobility: Why a Little Tension Can Have a Big Impact

We tend to think of tension as a localized issue. That is to say, we think of a stiff elbow as only a stiff elbow. We’d still say we have full mobility in the wrist and shoulder.

However, in the context of a golf swing, there is no such thing as a single restricted segment. A golf swing is not a seriesof movements, but a chainof movements, with each motion linked to the motions before an"

https://www.womensgolf.com/topping,"our topping may be caused by chicken winging which just means collapsing the leading elbow through impact. It is a really common fault and the cause of the most inconsistencies in golf. Most people do it in an attempt to try and help the ball up into the air.

Anne Rollo demonstrates the chicken wing swing faultPlace 3 tees in a row about 6 inches apart, with the first tee representing where the ball would be.
Swing your iron and try and clip all three tees with one swing. This encourages the extension through the ball that you need to eliminate tops and duffs.
If you tend to chicken wing it will cause you to hit the ground before the ball and that can cause you to come up at the ball so you wouldn’t be able to hit all three tees.

Also if you tend to cut across the line and pull the ball left or slice it to the right you’ll only hit the first tee.

Give the 3-tee drill a try. It will really help your contact and your consistency.

https://break80.guide/2019/02/best-golf-clubs/,"harting your clubs tells you what clubs you really rely upon. Take a notebook with you for your next seven rounds. Write down every club you use for each shot, along with the distance to the pin (if you can figure it). Then total up how often you used each club at the end of the round. After the seven rounds, total up how often you used each club. The clubs you use the most should form the core of your perfect set. Replace your little-used best golf clubs with ones you’re more likely to use on specific problem shots that you often face.
 
Get Fitted For Clubs
 
Research shows that up to 99% of players who play with fitted shafts hit the ball farther. Your results may differ, but there’s no denying that playing with fitted clubs makes a difference. While we can’t specify which clubs will be in your bag, we can tell you this: having fitted clubs saves your swing and keeps strokes off your scorecard. In addition, it provides you with a unique set of fitted clubs matched precisely to your needs and preferences. There have been exciting strides in terms of club fitting and technology over the past few years. If you’re working to balance your bag, a good fitting by a pro can make all of the difference."

Learning to score in golf, is often about playing the percentages.  When it comes to learning to do that, there’s an old adage that I’ve been using to start just about every beginning short game clinic I’ve given over the past quarter century.  “Putt when you can, chip if you can’t putt, and pitch only if you have to.” In truth, I’ve been using it so long I’ve forgotten where I first heard it and who it’s originally attributed to, but the reason I’ve stuck with it all these years is that it’s every bit as valid today as it was back then.

Putting is the easiest of the three, with the least downside for poor execution.  When you’re on the fringe, or the closely-mown approach just short of the green, putting is usually your best option for a handful of reasons.  First, hitting from those areas with your putter means you won’t be lofting the ball in the air and the lower the intended trajectory of the shot, the smaller the swing you need to make.  This also means there will be virtually no spin on the ball once you hit it, making the roll-out predictable.  And finally, using a putting stroke all but assures you are going to hit the ball first with little to no turf interfering with the solidness of contact either.

http://www.mikepedersengolf.com/stop-flipping-wrists-at-impact/,"Okay, so here’s the feel that I want. Here’s the simple, little tip. When you come into impact, you’ve got to have a cock in your right wrist here. So instead of flipping like this, you need to feel like you’re coming down like this. And the feel for you and the feel for me when I do this is that my handle is way ahead of my hands, way ahead of my club head when I come through impact. Something like this…. now I know this looks dramatic to you, but it won’t be once you do your actual swing.

But remember…when you’re doing drills, especially on the range, you need to go to the other extreme. Because what’s going to happen is, what you think you’re doing is what you’re not doing in real person live. I want you to feel like your hands are way ahead. Well, watch this, the feeling I got one time on the range was that I was going to take the palm of my hand, right here, and I was going to drive it through the ground past impact. The palm of my hand.

I wasn’t even thinking about my wrist at all at this point. I was thinking, even though the club was in my hand, I wanted to think about the palm driving down and through the ground like that. And watch what happens when you do that. Look at the lag.  I’m driving my palm down, look at that lag in the club.

https://neverunderpar.blog/2019/02/06/golf-at-the-heart/,"In a season in which the rules of golf have undergone significant change and dividing foursomes everywhere–flagstick in or out?  Two strokes for OB, but no distance?  Penalty area vs. hazard?  What is knee height anyway?–I’m struck by how little it should actually matter.  Golf is a big tent, or at least I want it to be, that draws people in for many reasons, but almost all of those reasons touch the heart in some way.  I would guess that the vast majority don’t play because of  a love of Rules (judges, lawyers, and high school vice principals not withstanding).

I have friends who are golf-adjacent.  They own clubs, have been to a driving range a few times, maybe even joined me for a round on a buddy’s trip.  But they haven’t caught the bug.  And from what I can tell, at least some of that is due to the expectation to understand and learn the behaviors golf traditionally demands not being worth the effort.  Think about what you do walking up to a green: drop your bag as close to the exit as possible, walk around everyone else’s ball, fix your ball mark, recognize who is next to play and if they want the flag in, mark your ball in the appropriate way and spot…and so on.  That’s a lot to learn!  And for some it is a deterrent.

But what if we just didn’t care?  What if the only rules you had to know were 1) Don’t slow down the group behind you and 2) Don’t put anybody in danger?  Sure, there’s a place for the full boat of rules. I play in a summer league, and I do enjoy the chance to play competitive rounds with USGA standards because it gets my competitive juices going.

Even the company admits that “the story behind the Ice Block putter is quite an odd one,” and that story begins with a Swiss surgeon with habit of inventing things from medical devices to golf clubs. The premise is that by creating a massive symmetrical head out of soft clear acrylic, you can enjoy the benefits of an equally massive sweet spot. The kicker is that on flat lies, the putter stands up on its own, allowing you set up to the ball, let go of the shaft, step away and look back through the clear head. You can literally walk around the thing, observe the alignment lines and adjust the putter angle accordingly for more precise alignment before taking your stroke. And when a Swiss surgeon talks about precision, you have to figure he may be on to something! This year, the Ice Block putter transitions from promising prototype to retail product. If you struggle with alignment and you don’t mind generating a lot of double takes from your peers on the green, it might be worth trying out.

I grew up during the Golden Age of American Golf, when Arnie still led his army on glorious charges and Nicklaus prowled the fairways striking fear into the heart of his adversaries.

As you’ve probably already figured out, I am a golf author. I like writing about golf because I find it to be such a wonderful metaphor for life. Both are a journey of sorts or, to be more accurate, a series of journeys, each with a distinct beginning and destination, goals if you will. Some of the journeys are longer than others. Some are quite short. All of them differ somewhat from the one before and the one to follow, each posing a unique set of challenges. Choices must be made regularly, hazards abound, competition is intense, risks are taken and accompanied by proportional rewards or punishment. Triumph can abruptly turn to failure and just as quickly back to triumph. And just as in the real world, success is measured against a given, and some might even say an inequitable, scale.

http://www.gorillagolfblog.com,"The par-three contest at the Masters gives the players an opportunity to let their hair down. It has a unique feel to it and caters to the family and friends of the players. Often there will be wives, children, grandchildren, and friends caddying. Caddies are encouraged to hit shots during the contest, which makes for fantastic viewing. It does, however, rule out a player’s eligibility to win the event should their caddie hit a shot.

This isn’t a problem for most of the players, as winning the par-three contest is believed to be bad luck. No one who has ever won the par-three shootout has gone on to claim a Green Jacket – so making themselves ineligible to win is often one of the goals. There are some who don’t buy into the superstition and give winning a good go, however.

Tom Watson was one and it is to be expected, at 68 years of age, Watson’s chances of taming Augusta are virtually nil. The eight-time major winner could afford to tempt fate by trying to win the par-three contest as he no longer competes in the main event. Watson bowed out of the Masters in 2016 when he made his final appearance.

http://golfgymblog.blogspot.com,"Casting the golf club is one of the dreaded ""Death Moves"" that will kill your distance on the golf course.

Casting is the action of releasing a ""lag"" or cocked position as you bring your club into the impact position from the top of the swing. If you were to think about being in water that was up to your waist, and you were starting your downswing, your hands should hit the water before your club head.

Holding that Lag position in the downswing will increase the speed of the club head as you come down and begin to release the club head into the ball striking, or impact zone.

In this video, I am using the GolfGym PowerSWING Plus unit attached to my driver. I explain the process of holding the lag position and the benefit of the PowerSWING Plus to help do that. The cords are designed to keep your hands in that ""cocked"" or lag position.

The 2019 Masters with Tiger Woods as a frontrunner reminded fans of days gone by, with steadfastness and purpose of action, shot-after-shot was placed almost effortlessly into scoring position.

As Woods gained strength and momentum during the Masters, golfer upon golfer laid a path to his eventual win. Even with a bogey on 18, Woods could not be caught, and the triumph was both sweet and spectacular to watch.

How did Tiger do it? He mentioned he had a game plan like all professionals do before they play in tournaments, but the average golfer rarely puts a plan into practice. In this blog, Golf for Beginners takes a look at the three reasons Tiger Woods won The Masters and what we, as amateurs, can do to improve our own golf games.

https://break80.guide/2018/12/master-your-golf-driver-swing/,"Want to crank out 25 more yards off the tee? And do it without taking a golf lesson. A study done by Golf Digest indicates that you can add 25+ yards to your drives by “hitting from the inside.”   That would take your game to the next level. That would be great, wouldn’t it?   When we say “coming from the inside” we mean swinging inside the target line. In other words, you approach the ball from the side of the target line nearest you. That generates an inside-out swing path. That, in turn, boosts power and control.   Many weekend golfers, however, swing on the target line’s far side. That produces an outside in swing, which can rob you of power and consistency.   Coming from the outside also makes it hard to achieve the right launch angle, preventing you from getting a lot of height on the shot. If you’re hitting low lines drives off the tee, this could be why.  "

You see, a fairway bunker is highly distance-elastic. What do I mean by that? Well, if you strike 1 inch behind the ball from 

a driving range mat, you might lose 3% distance
turf, you might lose 7% distance or more
but from a fairway bunker, strike an inch behind the ball and the distance can drop off by more than 40%.
Just goes to show how precise these guys are at striking the ball first, then turf – a reason why The Strike Plan has been such a success in improving golfers around the World.



Striking ball, then turf is so vital in golf – especially out of a fairway bunker. Hit that blue zone for crsip strikes from any lie.

So, the fact that Tiger Woods got the path left of the face is not that impressive (slicers do this all day long). But when you add in the fact that he

Woods had a chance to redeem himself in the afternoon foursomes session with a new partner Bryson DeChambeau. I walked with the group and it was like fire and ice between Europe and the U.S. Tiger and Bryson just kept exchanging terrible shots and putting each other in the worst spots, which would be anywhere except the fairway.

It was pretty depressing, but on the other hand, Tommy and Molinari were incredibly fun to watch; they have been an awesome duo and put on a fantastic show. The energy out here was nothing short of absolutely electric.

#Moliwood took down Woods/Bryson 5&4. Man, Tiger’s had to play against them THREE times. I guess he’s seen some great golf, but he’s also seen a lot of crap from his partners, too. He just seems tired, which is understandable — he won for the first time in five years, played five straight weeks, this week is exhausting and jetlag sucks."

The syntax was stilted, some scores were bizarre but the basic system was one I liked and has stood the test of time well. Over the years, whenever leaving course with my golfing partners we have found it pretty easy to find consensus on a score and we're rarely more than a point apart.

Bryson DeChambeau famously used science and physics to support his claim that the stick should stay in nearly all the time.

However, a new study refutes Bryson’s claim as reported by GolfDigest.com’s Mike Stachura. In fact, this thesis believes you should remove the flag 99.9% of the time.

His research on the value of leaving the flagstick in was precise, painstaking and perfectly clear. His findings upend the conventional wisdom that the flagstick is some kind of backstop, gathering wayward putts back into the hole. The facts of his study suggest the opposite, that the flagstick does much, much more to hurt your chances of a putt going in than help turn a bad putt into a made one.

Putts were rolled six at a time during various scenarios and speeds. Those included:

Ben and Charlie Crenshaw were headed across the parking lot at old Austin Country Club off Riverside Drive, ready to take on the back nine. They were dressed in T-shirts and cutoffs and had their well-worn golf bags – filled with collections of mismatched ladies and junior clubs – slung across their shoulders. 
It was the summer of '62. Ben was 10; Charlie was 11. They were inseparable back then, whether it was on the golf course, playing baseball or just hanging out. Two brothers, two best friends growing up in Austin in the '60s; two pretty good athletes just having fun and trying to get better. At whatever sport they were playing. 
Suddenly they saw a slightly older boy – dressed in slacks and a golf shirt -- carrying a new big red bag with a set of Wilson Staff clubs. He had red hair and glasses, brand-new golf shoes and a Texas drawl. His family had just moved down from Dallas and joined the club. 
His name was Tom Kite. 
""Y'all mind if I play the back nine with you?"" he said. 
The Crenshaw boys sized him up and said sure, c'mon."

Today, the Red course is a local favorite as it is the most player friendly option of the 3 courses at the resort.

In addition to the Red course, Robert Trent Jones Sr. marched onto the scene in 1965 and delivered 36 more holes of golf.  Honoring the history of the resort, the new courses were named after the colors of the Goodyear Tire logo, Blue and Gold.

Playing 7,345 yards from the back tees, the Gold course is the true championship test at the resort.  The course was once listed as a Top 100 golf course in America and has hosted numerous US Open qualifiers, NCAA Championships, and currently holds one of the top amateur competitions in the world, The Patriot All-America Invitational.

The greens sites also add to the difficulty of the round with dramatic slopes on a number of the putting surfaces.

Two of golf’s all-time greats battling it out in a one-on-one game for $9m, and the idea of them staking up their own money added needle and would have given the match some edge.

However, after it was announced that Warner Media had acquired the broadcast rights and it would be pay-per-view, it became fairly clear that this wasn’t a grudge match, rather a mere money-making exercise.

It’s impossible to make your child love a sport. Instead, if you dream of playing golf with your kids as they grow older, you should take steps to help them foster a love for it themselves. Here are some ways to get your kids into golf.

Summer Camps

Whether it’s a golf camp or just a summer camp with golf components, letting your children attend a summer sports camp is a great way to make sure sports are associated with great memories. True camps where you have to pack your weekend bag can be expensive, so don’t forget to look into day camps as a more budget-friendly option. At camp, your kids will be shown golf tips and tricks by pros, and they’ll also be encouraged to build friendships with others who have similar hobbies and interests.

Watch Golf at Home

By creating a dialogue with your kids about your favorite golfers and why you love to watch them, you can inspire your kids to want to watch golf as well. But proceed with caution: having golf channels on 24/7 will make your kids resent golf! Strike a balance between what your kids want to watch and what you want to watch. Put golf on in the background while you do activities together as a family, like cooking, cleaning, or doing a puzzle. Get your kids used to golf lingo through regular exposure."

The RBC Heritage didn’t get off to a strong start, but he’s hoping that his patience and determination will pay off soon.

Jordan Spieth is still battling his golf game.  This time, he’s at the RBC Heritage where he shot a first round even par after a double in his first nine holes.

The  hole has water all along the right side and then bonus water that curves around the back side of the green.  It’s intimidating, but to a player of Spieth’s capability, it should be an easy shot.

Well, it wasn’t. Instead of hitting 192 yards, or even 182 yards, he came up nearly 30 yards short. Water.  Penalty shot.  Hit from drop area and made five.  Not the way anyone wants to begin a tournament.

https://www.caledoniagolfandfishclub.com/blog/palmetto-championship-preview/,"his weekend at True Blue and Caledonia, some of the best high school teams in the country are competing at the Palmetto Championship – one of the premier high school golf events in the country. Twenty-nine different teams from around the country will be on display this weekend, as states such as South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas and Louisiana will be represented. There is even one team from Ontario. And yes, these young golfers are good!

The three-day events starts Thursday, March 29 with a Qualifying Round, in which the teams will be flighted based on the best scores. On Friday, the First Round starts at 7:30 a.m. at True Blue with the first qualifying flight from Thursday. Later that day, the championship flight will tee off at 12:15 p.m. over at Caledonia. Finally, on Saturday morning, the Final Round will take place at both courses with the first flight teeing off at 7:30 at Caledonia and the championship flight at 8:00 at True Blue.

Out of the 29 teams in this year’s Palmetto Championship, six come from South Carolina, including local school Waccamaw High School. Twenty-two of the remaining teams are from various states that include North Carolina, New Jersey, Rhode Island, California, Texas, and Louisiana. With an additional team traveling from Ontario, Canada, the field should feature a number of competitive rounds. 

Over the years, the Palmetto Championship has seen a number of notable players in its’ field, including Rickie Fowler, Harris English and Dru Love. Could we see another future PGA Tour player out there this weekend?

The Palmetto Championship is open to the public and all are welcome this weekend. We’ll have the dining rooms open at both courses, so grab a bite to eat while you are here watching the action."
https://topgolf.com/blog/post/why-are-we-turning-the-targets-blue/,"In general, a wish can be categorized into four buckets, I wish: to go, to be, to have or to meet. Make-A-Wish® transforms these wishes into a reality for children facing life-threatening medical conditions. On Saturday, April 29, we celebrate World Wish Day®, and Topgolf venues across the country will light the targets blue every 34 minutes to represent, on average, how often a child’s wish is granted.

My journey with Make-A-Wish started long before I knew what Topgolf was. I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma when I was 17 and immediately underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments. The experience was emotionally, physically and mentally challenging. Not only for myself, but for my family and friends, too.

With only a couple months of treatment left, my oncologist suggested that I consider meeting with Make-A-Wish. Truthfully, I was discouraged at first because I knew I would soon be in remission and leaving this chapter of life behind me. I didn’t want to take away an opportunity from a child who needed this kind of experience more than me. However, I reluctantly gave in and met with two wish granters who have the biggest hearts I had ever known."
https://topgolf.com/blog/post/the-next-generation-of-golf/,"As you spend the weekend watching countless hours of Masters coverage, you’ll see dozens of professionals with different swings, different sponsors, and different stories of how they got there. But they all have one thing in common: they each picked up a golf club for the very first time at some point in their lives.

It could have been on a putt-putt course at age 5. Or possibly on an actual course with dad at age 10. Or it could have been the desire to knock down a wasp nest by the garage at age 12 and a golf club was the only thing around to get the job done.

No matter the time or place, or even circumstance, the game of golf grows little by little with each interaction. It’s been that way for hundreds of years. Sure, equipment has evolved and courses have gotten longer, but the game has never been more accessible.

Topgolf is a perfect example of this.

You don’t need to own a set of clubs or have a membership to a course to have a great golf experience. Topgolf has all the benefits of the game without some of the most expensive aspects of it.

Professional golfers come to Topgolf all the time, but the time is fast approaching when a professional golfer will have started his or her career at a Topgolf.

https://golfgamebook.com/2019/03/07/digitalization-drives-the-development-of-golf/,"The new golf season has kicked off with a promising birdie-birdie start. The new rules of golf were introduced, and the first impression is that we are on the right track: revised rules make the game even more relaxed and faster.

We have also heard positive signals from the professional tours. Shorts are allowed in Pro-Ams, the ladies’ and men’s joint competitions will bring new flavor to the tour calendars and tour entities have successfully introduced new game modes that allow new kinds of tournaments experiences for both players as well as spectators.

At the same time, better digital services make it easier to play the game and enable a more fun golf experience both on and off the golf course. Digitalization is a fantastic opportunity to build onto the game, not take away from it. It has been great to witness how traditional golf organizations such as the R&A and USGA have begun to embrace digitalization as a cornerstone for the overall growth of the game."

WLGO is an annual national golf fundraiser conceived by Peter Hill, chief executive officer, Billy Casper Golf. Since its inception in 2011, more than 62,000 men, women, juniors and seniors have played in 34 states to raise $4.1 million for military charities.

Fisher House Foundation is this year’s selected charity for the fourth consecutive year. For over 25 years, Fisher House Foundation has provided a “home away from home” for families of patients receiving medical care at major military and VA medical centers. The 82 Fisher Houses across the United States, United Kingdom and Germany offer free, temporary lodging to military and veterans' families during medical crises and the healing process.

“WLGO’s constant kindness and support of our heroes was prominently displayed with their latest contribution,” says Dave Coker, president of Fisher House Foundation. “Billy Casper’s spirit lives on through the WLGO and we are eternally grateful for the ongoing and generous support.”

Golf course registration is now open nationwide to any public or private facility. There is no sign-up fee to participate in the WLGO. Player registration opens Wednesday, May 1st and donations are included in the registration fees. No USGA handicap is needed and players can sign up to play as a single, twosome or foursome. Golf courses can host an event or sign up a team to play at any participating locations.

Donations can be made at www.worldslargestgolfouting.com or by calling 703.940.3600. Come together to make a difference!"
https://www.northlandcountryclub.com/blog/53-getting-on-the-green-7-chipping-drills-to-improve-your-game,"Once you've mastered how to hit a chip shot, you can start to focus on aspects like direction and distance.

This is one drill that you can try at home, at the driving range or at a local park. 

To set up, place a hula hoop or mark out a similar sized circle with string. Place 8 golf balls at 5-yard intervals from the ring. 

Starting with the ball closest to the hoop, try to chip each one so that it lands within the hoop. Each time you get a ball in, move to the next furthest ball.

Every time you miss, start over again from the beginning. Don't quit until you can get all 8 balls into the hoop one after the other. 

3. CHIP-A-COIN DRILL

Here's one for those rainy days when hitting the course is out of the question. 

Place a few coins on your living room carpet and have a go at them with an old wedge. 

Try to send the coins cleanly into the air, or try to sink them in a strategically placed plastic cup. 

After a few hours of this, hitting a golf ball is a cinch. 

4. 10 X 10 DRILL 

This is one of the most important practice drills you can do. If you think about it, most of your golf game involves trying to hit the pin from 100 yards or closer.

So, when you head off to the driving range, that's what you should do. By all means have a go at working on your drive, but your focus should be closer in.

Use the markers on the driving range to practice your short game shots.

Preferably, find a big open area an mark off 10-yard intervals. Try to carry your shots exact distances to align with each marker."

But it wound up quite the international news story — thanks in part to a scoop by a little-known blog.

At first, a White House spokeswoman said the president had only played ""a couple of holes."" But then the golf blog No Laying Up wrote that Trump had actually played a full 18 — and was joined by one of the world's most recognizable athletes, golfer Rory McIlroy.

McIlroy took heat for accepting Trump's invitation; the White House issued a correction confirming the No Laying Up post.

""I got an anonymous tip,"" says Chris Solomon, co-founder of the golf blog as well as a companion podcast and Twitter account. ""[McIlroy] confirmed it. It was somehow not in the news yet. ... I typed it up in 20 minutes and the next thing you know, it is all over every website on the planet."""

https://datagolf.ca/does-experience-matter-at-augusta,"After five long winter months, the season’s first major is finally upon us. With Augusta’s arrival, there will be no shortage of narratives floating around as we all do our best to predict who will slip into the Green Jacket on Sunday night. 

One narrative you’ll undoubtedly hear this week is that past experience at Augusta National is a key contributor to success. 

This is an easy story to buy into; especially because, as golfers, we love the history and intricacies surrounding golf’s sanctuary, Augusta National. We grew up being told that it requires a level of strategy and patience that can only be learned through experience, or, if you’re lucky, an early-week stroll alongside a past Masters champion. But how much truth is behind this: do players who have more experience tend to play better at Augusta National? 

To make headway on that question, let’s start simple: the plot below shows strokes-gained (the number of strokes better than the field’s average) per round for each level of experience, where experience is defined by the number of previous Masters appearances. We use data from each edition of the Masters since 1995. "

It takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. You don't have that kind of time. What you need to do is perform deliberate golf practice to improve your golf game.

This will give you measurable results without the time commitment. Deliberate practice requires you to work on your specific weaknesses.

Practice in that area at high volume. Then get specific and continual feedback on performance.

Don't go to the driving range and hit balls with no purpose. Try these exercises to get started with your deliberate practice.

1. SWING HALF SPEED ON THE RANGE TO FIX A HOOK

Fix that dreaded hook by spending some time at the range. Slow down your speed so you can focus on your positioning.

By slowing down on purpose you prevent having an arm swing that is too fast. The slow down also lets you focus on turning your body more at the end.

Try to shift your weight to your front foot as you come down. You should end with your lower body facing your target. You want your hips to turn all the way through the swing."
https://www.andrewricegolf.com/andrew-rice-golf,"Far too often I see golfers consciously trying to swing down the line. This forces the hands out and necessitates a flip through impact. You can hit good shots with a flip, just not enough consecutive good ones to play well for all 18 holes.

Here are a few keys:

Work the handle around the lead hip through and post impact. It turns the corner…

The clubhead should arc back inside the flight of the ball very soon after impact whether you’re hitting draws or fades

Don’t be afraid to keep the club face relatively quiet, particularly if you struggle with blocks and hooks

Here is a simple half swing I made with a seven iron using a ClubHub sensor that clearly shows how the handle (light blue line) tracks inwards (and upwards) during the impact interval."

The players universally praised the putting surface and endorsed the decision to convert from Bermuda to paspalum as the right one. He was among the first to experience one of the main improvements to the courses on Kiawah.

The conversion to Paspalum was one of many improvements to Kiawah Island Golf Resort over a 20 year period starting in the mid-1990’s. The total expenditure to improve the player experience, for five golf clubs, including golf course renovations, building new clubhouses and ongoing capital improvements has exceeded $80 million dollars."
