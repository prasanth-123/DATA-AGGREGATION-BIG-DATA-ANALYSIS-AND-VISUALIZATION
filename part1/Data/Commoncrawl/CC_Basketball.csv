https://sportssignup.com/blog/6-best-youth-basketball-blogs-for-coaches,"Plenty of online resources are available for basketball coaches.These websites, including some blogs, dig into hardcore court strategy and are often geared toward high school and college coaches. Unfortunately, when looking for blogs that target rec coaches for younger players, the pickings are slimmer. In today’s competitive hoops environment that often drives players into AAU and high school play, rec youth basketball doesn’t quite get as much online attention as other sports (say, for example, soccer or baseball).

The challenge, of course, is finding advice for younger players—the ones who might end up not playing in high school but still deserve to learn the game, have fun, and be coached well. Teamwork, improvement, and perspective are just as important for 8-year-old rec players as they are for blue-chip recruits. Here are six youth basketball blogs we like that can appeal to rec coaches and parents of younger players:

 1. HowtoCoachYouthBasketball.com blog
This site is the blog of Flames Basketball, which is based out of the Kansas City area and sells coaching training videos. (Note: Any blogs here attached to a business are not endorsed by SIPlay; we’re including them for quality of the information offered on their websites.) What makes HowtoCoachYoutBasketball.com’s blog stand out is how much it is geared toward younger players. Posts such as “Basketball Positions—Are They Important at the Youth Level?” examine youth basketball from a realistic, fundamentals perspective. There aren’t many posts online, but the content is worth reading.

 2. Hoop Thoughts
This blog is written by Bob Starkey, an assistant coach for Texas A&M’s women’s basketball team. Though some of the content is higher-level strategy, some is geared toward general coaching philosophy and preparation. If you love coaching and want to see how others approach the craft, this blog is an entertaining read.

 3. Youth Basketball Coaching Association blog
Besides producing some original content, this blog, produced by the Youth Basketball Coaching Association, reposts articles from other sites, including some from other sports that also can apply to basketball (such as this post: “Parenting from the Stands”). The content is a mix of coaching and sports parenting topics along with drills and strategies.

 4. Pro Skills Basketball blog
Pro Skills Basketball is a youth basketball organization that operates in five states. Although its blog does talk about recruiting and higher-level hoops, the content also discusses youth basketball and the sports culture that sometimes can seem a bit overwhelming. The blog has been publishing for about a year and generally posts a few updates a month.

 5. Coaching Basketball—My Dream
John Carrier, who head coaches a sophomore basketball team in Minnesota, has written this blog since 2008. His approximately 250 posts offer thoughts on coaching philosophies as well as game and practice strategies. Although his content is geared toward more for coaches of older kids, he loves the game, and his words can easily apply to any youth basketball coach interested in what others are thinking.

 6. Layups & Rebounds
Former NBA and University of Utah star Keith Van Horn writes this blog, and it’s definitely not what you might expect from someone who played at the highest level of basketball. Van Horn’s content delves into issues of sports parenting and the risk of pushing youth basketball players too hard, too fast. The posts are a dose of reality from someone who is passionate about youth sports and maintaining the proper perspective with young athletes. Unfortunately, Van Horn doesn’t post often, but the existing content should be required reading for any coach or parent of youth basketball (or any other sport, for that matter) players."
https://www.breakthroughbasketball.com/fundamentals/ball-handling-consistency-tips.html,"As much as basketball seems to be about highlight plays--who dunked the hardest, who crossed who, who shot the game winning bucket -- it’s not.

And never has been.

Generally, basketball is a game that entirely revolves around consistency. Making a game-winning shot is fantastic -- perhaps even a memorable life event for serious players -- but if you were never a consistent shooter in the first place, the game might not have ever been that close to even attempt a game-winner. In other words, you needed consistency to even have the chance at winning.

In the realm of basketball, consistency is king.

In this particular article, I want to talk about gaining game-time consistency and in a specific area -- ball handling.

You could have the best ball-handling workouts in existence, but still might find yourself “cursed” come game time.

For whatever reason, no one steals the ball from you in practice, but your ball-handling (especially if you’re a guard) seems to be a detriment in game. Something that’s holding you back. Where one move to the basket had you protecting the ball at all times, you might have been easily stripped of the ball on a different play.

With hard work and specific drills in game-time scenarios, this can be changed. Don’t be discouraged. Although turnovers may be the ugliest thing in basketball, not improving is even uglier.


Ball Handling Consistency Tip # 1 - Simulate Game-Like Pressure
To build your ball-handling consistency, especially to deal with a high-pressure, game-like environment, simulate as much pressure as you can while you go through drills or practice.

Basic ball-handling drills like “Figure 8,” “Zig zag cross over,” etc., aren't always enough. You need to incorporate ball-handling drills with defensive pressure. If you're not doing this, you’re truly missing out.

If you can overcome simulated game-pressure in practice, you’re much more likely to protect the ball in a real game situation.

For example, incorporating 1v1 full court, and/or 1v2 drills in your workout is a highly effective way to build consistency under pressure.

In one such drill, have the ball-handler start out at the base-line. With two defenders pressuring the ball, the goal of this drill is to split the defense and score on the opposite hoop (full-court).

In doing so, players can be expected to confront difficult ball-handling situations head-on -- with no option to be bailed out. In a sink or swim environment, it’s much easier to gain specific skills, in this case ball-handling, you otherwise wouldn’t have.

Variations on this drill include adding another defender (for a total of three), splitting the court in half to restrict spacing, and restricting the amount of dribbling.

Getting completely comfortable with these kinds of pressure situations is the best thing to do to ensure your confidence in-game.

How difficult can a defender be in-game if you’re already accustomed to being double-teamed?

If you’d like to further increase your ball-handling consistency with specific workouts, check out more of our progressive ball-handling drills here.


Ball Handling Consistency Tip # 2 - Put In The Time & Find Different Competition
Another important aspect to consistency, in all aspects of the game, is simply the sheer amount of time you can spend on a competitive court.

For example, if your team practices twice a week, and that’s the only time you spend on a court, this means you as well as your team are potentially all improving at the same rate. (Some players may practice “harder” than others and get better quicker, but on average, players won’t see massive improvement over their peers if they solely practice with the same group of players.)

If, at all possible, change this.

It sounds too simple to be true, but I can assure you, the most consistent players I know also have the most consistent and often court-time.

They’re used to game pressure because they put it upon themselves on a regular basis.

Playing on another, even more difficult court, on top of your normal practices and games, will ensure your consistency improves at an optimal level.

Expect not only your ball-handling consistency to increase, but your entire game to be brought up a notch, as well."
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/6159-five-basketball-websites-you-cant-live-without,"Every morning I wake up and go through the exact same routine.

The coffee maker is set for 7:25 am. As the coffee drips into the pot, I roll out of bed and pop open my laptop.

I've got a bookmark folder on my toolbar that's labeled ""AM""—as in, these are things I like to read in the morning.

When you have as many bookmark folders on your toolbar as I do, you need to come up with creative ways to abbreviate them so that you can squeeze as many of them onto the toolbar as you possibly can.

For example, the one with all my banking information is labeled ""$$,"" and the one that contains all the sites that would be deemed ""NSFW"" are under the title ""BS"". You'd think that ""NSFW"" would suffice, but that's a little perverted—and you don't question why we have a special symbol (&) for a three-letter word like ""and,"" so leave me alone. 

I'm a fan of all major sports, but the game that really gets my juices flowing is basketball. Ask any other guy living in L.A. that's in his 30s or 40s and he'll probably tell you the same thing.

Sure, the Dodgers have had success in my lifetime. There's also no denying that USC Football is huge in the Southland. But basketball—and specifically, the Lakers—are the oil that keeps this city's engine running. Eight championships and 13 Finals appearances in my lifetime alone. I don't think that requires any other explanation.

There are a number of various sports, news and entertainment sites I like to look at every day. But a number of those I could live without. But there are five basketball-related websites that are not only bookmarked on my laptop, but also on my PDA:

1. HoopsHype.com

Probably the most popular basketball website in the world. Unlike a lot of sports websites, HoopsHype is a seven-day-a-week operation. Each day the fine folks at HoopsHype comb the world's basketball-related newspapers and blogs, and package the main talking points into a neatly-presented one-stop-shop for basketball-related news.

Covering everything from the NBA to the international and minor leagues as well as prison leagues, HoopsHype is the bible for most NBA fans. In addition to news, the site also has sections devoted to player and team salaries, transactions, the NBA Draft, and articles and blogs from current and former NBA players like Eddie Johnson as well as noted NBA columnists like Roland Lazenby.

2. RealGM.com

RealGM.com could be described as HoopsHype meets ESPN. It's like a more abbreviated version of HoopsHype, in that it concentrates on only the biggest stories. HoopsHype is for the guy that has an hour to kill. RealGM is more for the guy that only has fifteen minutes.

RealGM also scours the nation's newspapers for links and can boast about it's own knowledgeable columnists, but it's RealGM's ""GM Resources"" that separates it from HoopsHype.

Way before the ESPN Trade Machine, RealGM had it's own trademarked Trade Checker. Much more detailed and specific, there are some proposed trades that the Trade Machine will approve that the Trade Checker won't and it will explain exactly why. RealGM is the perfect site for the guy that doesn't want to shell out $40 a year to get ESPN Insider.

3. Larry Coon's NBA Salary Cap FAQ

If a Nobel Prize would ever be awarded for basketball, then Larry Coon would be its first recipient. This kind soul has taken something as complex as the NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement and put it into a CliffsNotes version—absolutely free.

Coon breaks down everything from the soft cap, to luxury tax amnesty provisions, to how a team's salary cap is affected when a player dies. He presents it in an idiot-proof FAQ format so that it's simple to navigate and find out what it is you're looking for without having to go through the entire site.

It's sites like this that will probably lead to libraries being closed down in the next twenty years. It will also lead to hundreds of more people like me who think they're capable of becoming agents without going to law school.

4. NBADraft.net

Have you ever heard of Omer Asik or Predrag Samardziski? Neither had I. NBADraft.net has both of them projected as second-round picks in next year's draft. If you haven't heard of NBADraft.net by now, then you should definitely check it out. It's a throwback to sites from a few years ago that believe that less is more.

The homepage contains a projection of both rounds of the NBA Draft and is updated constantly. Each player listed has his own page with a scout's take on his strengths and weaknesses, a grading system that measures the prospect in twelve different categories as well as an NBA comparison for each player.

The site also contains a draft history page that allows you to easily compare the star-studded 1996 draft with that of 2003. There are other great things you can find at NBADraft.net, such as a 2009 Mock Draft that includes current high school seniors and college players deemed not ready to enter this year's draft. There's also an ""Outstanding Trades"" page that shows you all of the conditions on draft picks that have been included in trades.

The site really kicks into high gear after the draft lottery. It's also a great page to track the draft as it's going on.

5. Patricia's Various Basketball Stuff

Patricia's Various Basketball Stuff is about as no-frills as a website can get. It's like going back to the Internet in 1994. There are no photos, no crazy fonts, and no ads—just information, and lots of it.

Patricia Bender has created a website that has basic information like team rosters, standings and scores. But it also has obscure things that you'd spent hours searching the net for if they weren't all in this one place. You can get a listing of all of the NBA's retired numbers, player salaries going back to the 1985-86 season, and year-by-year capsules of the draft, All-Star games, regular season and playoffs.

The text-only format makes it perfect for mobile phone and PDA browsers. She hasn't posted current player salaries, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were up by the trade deadline."
https://www.nbccamps.com/blog/basketball/ignite-greatness-in-basketball,"Becoming great at anything is a long and laborious process and sometimes not very fun.  It’s easy to be a consumer—to watch, to enjoy, to be an audience member.  Life requires full participation in the pain, challenge and difficulty of any great endeavor.  Basketball is a great and worthy artist sport.  Great players are poetry in motion. They play with such grace, skill and mastery they inspire and ignite our love and attention.

Here are a few ways to become a player who ignites the court.

Your body is a vessel for your passion, energy, enthusiasm and courage. Your body communicates these qualities clearly to everyone who sees you.  If you are  filled with fear, apathy, bitterness, frustration, dread, lack of confidence… all these emotions fill the gym whether you mean to or not.  Discipline your body to ignite the court and the gym with a blazing fire of confidence, courage and commitment to giving your best. Set your internal spirit on fire and your brilliance will inspire.

Mastering a sport requires dedication to the fundamentals. Can you dribble with great dexterity and fully master the ball freeing your mind to problem solve. If you want to be great at basketball, you must have this skill. Love for the foundational elements of the game is crucial. Watching Steph Curry's master class you will see how much attention he pays to the quality of the basketball foundation. His stance is picture perfect and he never compromises this foundation. Too many athletes get apathetic on the fundamentals wanting the flashy moves but your ability to launch into a serious future relies on a serious platform for secure skills and fundamentals.

Catch on fire for what is challenging to love—getting in shape, working hard, discipline in the gym. If you can ignite your passion for what isn’t easy, you will be a game changer.  When you set the example of loving what is tough, everything elevates. Your teammates become inspired.  It only takes one person to dive on the floor and greatest gets ignited.

https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2831881-kyrie-remains-bostons-star-but-21-year-old-jayson-tatum-controls-celtics-fate,"As much as Uncle Drew dazzles in the regular season, Playoff Kyrie Irving ups the ante from every angle.

Irving did Irving things early and often during the Boston Celtics' Game 2 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday. The Shamrocks needed every last one of them, as the Victor Oladipo-less Pacers were typically quicker to the basketball, flowed better on offense and played with relentlessness on the other end.

For 47 minutes, it seemed Irving and the Pacers would trade body blows until the final whistle. Then Jayson Tatum happened.

The 21-year-old owned the final minute. His fingerprints were found on eight of the 10 points scored in that stretch, which turned a 91-89 Boston deficit into a 99-91 win for the preseason favorite now looming as the Eastern Conference's biggest wild card.

Tatum's corner triple off a delicious dime from Jaylen Brown gave the Celtics a 92-91 advantage with 50.8 seconds remaining. The next time down, he fed a cutting Gordon Hayward to push Boston's lead to 94-91. One horrifically timed Pacers miscue later—Wesley Matthews' inbounds pass went out of bounds—Tatum sealed the victory by hammering home an and-1 flush."
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2019-nba-playoffs-kyrie-irving-dazzles-jayson-tatum-closes-as-celtics-take-2-0-series-lead-against-pacers/,"Using a big run to erase a 12-point fourth-quarter deficit, the Boston Celtics took a 2-0 series lead over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night with a 99-91 Game 2 home victory. It was definitely a defensive game, but nowhere near the 84-74 slugfest the teams played in the opener on Saturday.

Boston was led by Kyrie Irving, who scored a game-high 37 points on 15-for-26 shooting, including 6-for-10 3-pointers, while handing out seven assists. Jayson Tatum added 26 points, including some clutch late buckets to help seal the win for Boston.

Indiana had four players in double figures, led by Bojan Bojanovic's 23 points on 4-of-8 3-point shooting, but the Pacers once again struggled to put the ball in the basket when it mattered most. 

Here are a few takeaways from Boston's Game 2 win.

Kyrie, Kyrie, Kyrie
Irving is one of the best scorers in the NBA, and his full arsenal was on display during Wednesday's Game 2. Irving had pretty much every facet of his offensive game working, hitting 3-pointers, mid-range pull-ups, and finishing at the rim. With his team trailing by four in the fourth quarter, Irving checked in at the 7:35 mark and proceeded to knock down two 3-pointers to give Boston the lead and all the momentum."
https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2019/04/kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-squeak-out-a-tough-game-2-10-things-we-learned.html,"BOSTON -- The Boston Celtics eked out a difficult Game 2 victory against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday to hold serve at home and send the series back to Indianapolis with a 2-0 lead.

Here are 10 things we learned from Wednesday’s game.

1. Don’t be too concerned by the close scores.

The Celtics are clearly more talented than the Pacers, and they have now had to scratch and claw their way out of a pair of tight games at home. Should Celtics fans be worried now that the team is headed out on the road (and, looking down the road, should they be concerned about future series’ based on their start to this one)?

Here’s the thing: Indiana plays extremely hard, and having NBA players who play extremely hard is a powerful force. In the postseason, blowouts are difficult (and this year is extra evidence: Games that start as blowouts can become much closer very quickly). When contests matter, they are often much more difficult to win comfortably.

“A win is a win,” Terry Rozier said afterward. “I was taught that: A win is a win. You gotta take it however you’re going to get it.”

2. The transition stats evened out considerably.

On Sunday in Game 1, the biggest difference was transition, where the Celtics pummeled Indiana with fast-break opportunities. On Wednesday, those numbers evened out: Both teams struggled in half-court sets, but both teams were about equal on points in transition. The biggest difference? Per Cleaning the Glass, Indiana added just under five points via transition chances off live steals. In other words: The turnovers were a problem.

3. I can’t stop watching Irving’s exaggerated jump stop.

This is something Irving does especially well: He creates a lot of space for himself, but he often also takes an extra split second at the bottom of his shot to steady himself -- just long enough to make it feel a little unnatural, but also to steady himself.

Here’s one.

The way Irving plants both feet allows him to get a great base for his jumper, and then he just sort of avoids the shot block. It’s a tiny trick, but one that seems to help him quite a bit.

4. Terry Rozier picking up players full-court helped.

Brad Stevens noted in his post-game press conference how much it helped to have constant pressure on opposing ball-handlers, which was one of the reasons Rozier got extended minutes.

“I’ve been picking full court all my life,” Rozier said. “From High school, AAU, college playing for Rick. It’s not nothing new to me. Obviously I was just trying to take them out of their rhythm, push everything up, and make it tough for them. I feel like if I could do that, it’s already -- you look up it’s probably like 10 seconds on the shot clock and then they gotta rush. That’s just my whole thing. Obviously I don’t want them to relax when they’re playing us.”

5. The home crowd helped.

Jaylen Brown pandered to the crowd shamelessly in his on-court post-game interview. Kyrie Irving dropped glowing quotes about the atmosphere at TD Garden.

But the TD Garden has only felt like a real playoff crowd at a couple of points so far (fans still seem a little wary of this inconsistent team, which will almost certainly fall away if they begin living up expectations). The first explosion was during the introductions on Sunday, when the 1 p.m. crowd was rowdy from the jump. The second was Wednesday, after this play.

https://www.blazersedge.com/2019/4/18/18484566/video-breakdown-portland-trail-blazers-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba-playoffs-pick-and-roll-defense,"So much of the focus entering the Portland Trail Blazers’ first round series against the Oklahoma City Thunder orbited around Portland’s center rotation. After Jusuf Nurkic went down late in the season, I wrote an extensive preview of four of their potential playoff opponents and how they might attack new starter Enes Kanter, who had never exactly been known for his defensive prowess, especially in pick-and-roll. As it turned out, the Trail Blazers drew the Thunder, who possess a strong pick-and-roll attack but also have significant weaknesses offensively that make them easier to defend. Namely, Oklahoma City’s lack of outside shooting threats has been very important for the series, as Portland has been able to pack the paint to help onto drives and rolls to the rim, alleviating some of Kanter’s responsibilities inside. Combine that with a better-than-expected series from Kanter himself and the Trail Blazers currently own the playoffs’ second-best defense through two games in each series, only trailing the Milwaukee Bucks, who are playing against a hapless Detroit Pistons team missing their best player.

The other side of the court has been a bit more of an adventure, as a very good Oklahoma City defense has held the Trail Blazers to 95.6 points per 100 possessions through two games, the tenth-best offense in the playoffs. A +13.5 net rating through two games has Portland in firm command of the series as things shift to Oklahoma City, but there are plenty of historical reasons to think the Thunder will be better on both ends at home. Role players tend to shooter better at home, which may poke some holes in a Portland defense that’s mostly left those guys open, while the backing of the home crowd will give a little extra verve to the Thunder’s defenders.

Through two games in Portland, the aggressive defense Oklahoma City employs in pick-and-roll has been relatively successful, holding the Trail Blazers to an 81.0 offensive rating on these possessions, the fourth-worst mark in the playoffs. While there’s very little about which Portland should be worried in an overall sense, there are still cracks in their offensive attack that can be shored up to ensure this series is terminated as quickly as possible and the club moves on to the next round. In particular, some of the hedging from center Steven Adams has given the Portland ball handlers some trouble, much like the aggressiveness of the New Orleans Pelicans did in their first round series last year.

In Game 2, the Trail Blazers found some counters, each different from the last, to help them deal with Oklahoma City’s aggressiveness at the point of attack. As the series has progressed, Portland has moved their ball screens further and further out on the floor. Damian Lillard’s seemingly unlimited range adds this dimension to their offense – if Adams lays back on a ball screen near the logo at half court, Lillard will take one dribble toward the basket and nail a 30-footer, as he’s done several times already. The end result is having Adams way out on the floor, but to say he’s uncomfortable that far from the rim is an understatement, so he retreats quickly as Kanter rolls to the rim and Oklahoma City looks to reset their defense"
https://fansided.com/2019/04/18/james-harden-brilliant-rockets-dominate-jazz-game-2/,"Before the playoffs began, we used this space to check in on six key questions that would help decide who won the first-round series between the Portland Trail Blazers and Oklahoma City Thunder. The Blazers now lead that series 2-0 after sweeping their home-game set, so we figured now was as good a time as any to check back in on the same six questions and see what the Thunder might be able do to reverse some of the trends that have hurt them so far, and potentially get themselves back into the series as it moves to Oklahoma City.

Here we go …

1. How will Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum deal with OKC’s size and pressure?
So, this is the big question the Blazers have working in their favor so far.

Lillard, in particular, wilted under the Pelicans’ pressure on the ball last year, and he has reversed that in a big way so far in this series. He’s scored 59 points in two games to go along with 10 assists, and he’s shooting 19-of-42 from the field and 9-of-19 from 3. Oh, and he’s taken 15 free-throws. Test: passed. McCollum struggled shooting in Game 1 but practically burst into flames at one point during Game 2, and he’s got 57 points and 8 assists on 21-of-45 from the field and 6-of-14 from deep.

The two guards have manipulated Oklahoma City’s pick-and-roll coverage splendidly, alternately using screens and rejecting them, splitting defenders and scooting around them, driving to the rim and stepping back, hitting short-rollers and finding outlet men. None of Steven Adams or Jerami Grant or Nerlens Noel has been able to contain either of them off the dribble.

Simply put, if the Thunder can’t figure out how to better execute their pick-and-roll defense, they’re not coming back in this series. Adams and Grant are leaving far too much space for the ball-handlers to either split or snake on the pick-and-roll, either of which is death to the kind of coverage they’re playing. They need to force these guys to string out their dribble and throw lobbed passes over the top to players like Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and then force those guys to make plays on the move by recovering in time to contest quick shots. It’s a tall order, obviously. But this is the playoffs; nothing is going to be easy.

2. Will Portland’s other guys hit their shots this year?
The Blazers got an absolutely monster game from Kanter in Game 1 (20 points, 18 rebounds) and across-the-board good performances from their supporting cast in Game 2, but were particularly buoyed by a terrific game from Moe Harkless (14 points, 9 rebounds) and timely shooting from Seth Curry.

Oklahoma City should, in theory, be well-equipped to deal with the Blazers’ supplementary players. Kanter is difficult to guard on the block, has good footwork in pick-and-roll situations, and crashes the offensive glass as well as anyone in the league, but all of those things are defensive strengths of Adams. He is one of the league’s best post defenders. He is used to sliding his feet and sticking with guards and bigs in pick-and-rolls. And he’s a premier box-out guy. If he can’t handle Kanter and keep him from impacting the game in positive ways, that’s a big issue for the Thunder. Adams did a far better job on him in Game 2, but other problems presented themselves elsewhere.

Not having Andre Roberson as another defensive option on the perimeter hurts the Thunder greatly in this series. Terrance Ferguson is getting fried by McCollum (CJ is 8-of-13 from the field and the Blazers have scored 76 points on the 60 possessions where Ferguson has been McCollum’s primary defender, per Second Spectrum matchup data on NBA.com), and there’s not much reason to think he’d any do better defending Lillard. George has spent most of his time defending Harkless and/or Aminu, which seems like something of a waste but might be necessary because A. the offensive burden he has to carry is significant; and B. it helps to have your best defender as the guy roaming around trying to wreak havoc off the ball. Unfortunately, it hasn’t worked out that way so far.

3. Can the Blazers get passable defense (and playmaking) out of Enes Kanter?
Again, Kanter was huge in Game 1. He was all over the offensive and defensive glass. He made plays in space. And he held up well enough defensively to stay on the floor. That was not the case in Game 2, but the Blazers found ways to make up for it.

Oklahoma City needs to keep in mind what Donovan said about Kanter few years ago: namely, that you can’t play him (because he can’t hang in pick-and-roll defense). Run pick-and-rolls right at him every time until the Blazers take him off the floor.

4. Is there any answer for Paul George’s pick-and-roll snakes?
As we noted prior to the series:

Paul George against the Blazers this season: 38 points, 10.5 rebounds, 5.5 assists per game on a 45-46-85 shooting line. There’s a reason for this, and it comes down to the way George’s preferred method of offensive attack works against the Blazers’ preferred method of guarding pick-and-rolls.

Namely, the Blazers prefer to drop the big man back into the paint and coax ball-handlers into a pocket of space near the elbows while George counteracts that strategy by snaking his way around the screen in order to find himself in even more open space than the Blazers would prefer to give him. George also developed a ridiculously rude counter-move where he catches the defender leaning toward the screen + snake, and crosses back over as quickly as humanly possible, while Adams flips the screen in order to create space so that George can step back into an open 3.

George was then miserable in Game 1, shooting 8-of-24 from the field and generally looking not too much like himself. The shoulder injury seemed to clearly be bothering him throughout the game, and he was both not getting to his spots like he usually does and missing makeable shots when he did get to them. He was quite a bit better in Game 2 and in the first half seemed to relish showing that his shoulder was OK, shimmying it several times after made jumpers. But he did not look anything like the unstoppable force he was during the teams’ four regular-season matchups.

Portland has not really altered its coverages too much here; they’re just doing a really good job of executing and forcing him into somewhat uncomfortable looks, and he’s not making enough of the relatively easy looks he’s been able to get. Saying “just make more shots” is silly as an adjustment, but George probably needs to do a bit of a better job creating space for himself once he gets into the middle of the floor, and getting Harkless or Aminu off his back so that he can operate in space rather than a crowd.

5. How does OKC align defensively?
It’s largely been Westbrook on Lillard and Ferguson or Dennis Schroder on McCollum, and it has mostly not worked. Dame hasn’t shot particularly well when defended by Russ (6-of-19) but the Blazers have scored at an efficient rate nonetheless, and the Thunder have been blitzed with Ferguson on McCollum. As mentioned previously, the fix here seems to be less about particular matchups and more about the Thunder doing a better job of executing their scheme.

6. Will Westbrook be Westbrook or will he beat Westbrook?
So … 50-50, basically? Westbrook has 29 rebounds and 31 assists through two games. That’s to be expected. He was 8-of-17 from the field in Game 1 and OKC kept it close, and he was just 5 of 20 in Game 2 and they got blown out in the second half. He hasn’t made many particularly egregious defensive errors or turnovers and he has not gotten too shot-happy, but if George isn’t going to be the world-beater that he was for much of the regular season, then the Thunder cannot afford to have Westbrook shoot poorly as well. Perhaps using his size advantage on Lillard to go into the post early in the game could get him into rhythm, and then allow the Thunder to play off of him on the block. And again, attacking downhill against Kanter in space is a must."
https://www.sbnation.com/2019/4/17/18411958/damian-lillard-highlights-better-russell-westbrook-thunder-vs-blazers,"After scoring 30 points that felt like 40 in Game 1, Damian Lillard put up 29 points in Game 2 of Portland’s first-round series against Oklahoma City. Each one of his buckets felt like a dagger to the heart. In propelling Portland to a 2-0 series lead, they may have also been a dagger to the Thunder’s playoff hopes.

On one play, Lillard made a meme out of Raymond Felton, turning him around with a nasty crossover before ending the third quarter at the buzzer with a step-back three.

And the two most telling possessions of the night were when Lillard matched up against Russell Westbrook. On one, he knocked the ball out of Westbrook’s hands, then out-hustled him to the loose ball. On the other, Lillard stopped Westbrook, forcing the Thunder guard into a contested three. Then he flexed his arms to celebrate the stop, took two dribbles past half-court, and nailed an absolute bomb from at least 30 feet out.

This is the best version of Lillard: the assassin, the cold-blooded killer, the fiery competitor, the motivated leader, the player for whom there is no answer. Call him what you want: Dame Dolla or Logo Lillard. Maybe it’s time to call him the best player on the floor.

In a series where the Thunder have a both triple-double machine and a dual candidate for both MVP and Defensive Player of the year, the Trail Blazers have the difference maker.

Damian Lillard is that good
It was only a couple months ago that Westbrook issued Lillard a reminder: the Thunder have been beating the Trail Blazers for years. More specifically, Westbrook wanted to remind Lillard: “I’ve been busting your ass for years.”

But damn, the tables have turned. Lillard is averaging 35 points in the four games since then, including 51 points on March 7 and the two dominant playoff victories he’s led Portland to this series.

Lillard has made nine threes in this series, on 47 percent shooting from downtown. The Thunder are shooting 10-of-61 from downtown in the first two games. No matter which way you slice it, he’s outplaying all of Oklahoma City.

This is awful news for OKC. Yes, the series is shifting to their house for Games 3 and 4, and teams generally play better with their home crowd behind them. But the Trail Blazers have been far and away the better team in this series. Portland just destroyed Oklahoma City by 20 in Game 2. The Thunder looked outmatched, maybe even outclassed.

Stephen Curry is the de facto best player at his position, but Lillard is making his case to be No. 2. From what we’ve seen through two games, Lillard is just a step ahead of his competition."
https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/4/18/18412641/joel-embiid-knee-sixers-brett-brown-future-nba-playoffs,"Joel Embiid apologized, but it didn’t seem sincere. The laughing sort of gave it away. The opening game of the Sixers’ first-round playoff series against the Brooklyn Nets hadn’t left Philadelphia with much to joke about. The Nets were a heavy underdog but won at the Wells Fargo Center on Saturday, leaving some people panicked. The Sixers returned the favor in the second game and thumped the opposition—in at least one case, literally.

Before and during the series, there was a lot of talk from Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson and his Sixers counterpart Brett Brown about “haymakers” and “fistfights” and going “toe-to-toe.” Atkinson said their opponents “held us, pushed us” and “really got into us” in Game 2. He classified the second bout as “extreme physicality.” You could say that, yes.

Poor Jarrett Allen. At one point on Monday evening, Allen’s face made the regrettable mistake of getting between Embiid’s elbow and the basket. If nothing else, Allen has a better jaw than Andrei Svechnikov.

“Obviously, it wasn’t intentional,” Embiid said. “I got him pretty good and I’m sorry about it.”

The Sixers have not shot well from distance in the series—they’ve made just 12 of 48 3-pointers—but they’ve been excellent down low. They’ve outrebounded the Nets in both games by a wide margin (plus-32), and they’ve scored more points in the paint (plus-20). Atkinson said the Sixers “dominated” the Nets in both areas. That obviously had a lot to do with Embiid, who notched a double-double for the second straight game in limited minutes. In Game 2, he also scored the first seven points in a blowout 51-point third quarter (tied for the most points in a quarter in NBA history).

But the Allen thing, Embiid was just so sorry about that, you know? Here, again, the mischievous smirk on his face suggested otherwise. He apologized a second time, and Simmons laughed a second time.

“I’m not usually humble,” Embiid said. He gestured toward Simmons. “That’s why he’s laughing.”

No. Embiid is not usually humble. Barely a month ago, he peacocked in a nationally televised postgame interview after the Sixers beat the rival Celtics. Embiid had a game-high 37 points, 22 rebounds, four assists, a steal, and a block against Boston that night. He felt pretty good about it.

“I’m the most unstoppable player in the league,” he boasted.

It was a bold statement, and it might even be true. But for it to be true, he has to be on the floor, and that hasn’t always been the case. Not lately, and not for long stretches of his career. After the All-Star break, Embiid missed 13 of the team’s final 23 games. The Sixers initially attributed it to “load management,” then later revealed that Embiid was experiencing pain in his left knee due to what they diagnosed as tendinitis. Embiid said he’s “playing through the pain” and seemed to realize that, without him, the Sixers are a dimmer, less dangerous version of their best selves. They were plus-5.8 with Embiid on the court this season and minus-1.9 without him, according to NBA.com/Stats. But all the stats in the world only confirm what anyone can see: The Sixers are really good with Embiid and something south of that without him.

In a playoff promo for ESPN, Embiid was conscripted into a bit of forced humility for the purposes of propaganda and leaguewide PR. “It’s not just about me,” he said with a straight face into the camera. Except it really is.

After Game 1, Brown said Embiid looked “tired,” and Embiid called himself “out of shape.” During parts of Game 2, I thought he looked sloooow in certain stretches as he lumbered up the court well behind the rest of the pack.

Embiid’s Game 1 line: 25 minutes, 22 points (5-15 FG, 0-5 3PT, 12-18 FT), 15 rebounds, four assists, five blocks.

Embiid’s Game 2 line: 21 minutes, 23 points (8-12 FG, 0-0 3PT, 7-8 FT), 10 rebounds, one assist.

Embiid was questionable to play in both games. Imagine if he was fully healthy and not on a minutes restriction. Jarrett Allen would need a goalie mask.

“Obviously, missing so many games, it’s hard to find a rhythm,” Embiid said. “And also being on a minute restriction it’s hard to find a rhythm.”

“We might lose, but we’re alive. Buy three more days. This is just the path we’re on with Joel.” —Brett Brown
He said he tries to forget the pain when he’s on the floor. That’s probably not so easy. He hasn’t practiced during the series. When we were let into the Sixers’ training facility for media availability earlier this week, Embiid was facedown on a table at the opposite end of the court with a member of the medical staff working over his body, all of it. Before the series started, Embiid initially told us “the pain level has changed. It’s gotten worse.” He said it bothered him only when “jumping. Landing. Moving. The game of basketball.”

Given that their star basketball player is in pain when playing “the game of basketball,” and considering how terribly that opening game went, you’d expect these to be tense times for the Sixers. The vibe surrounding the team—with the noted exception of questions concerning Embiid’s health—has been surprisingly loose, though. Simmons kept insisting—both before the series started and then again between the first two games—that there was “no pressure.” And if anyone was secretly hoping that Jimmy Butler would pop off after the Game 1 loss, they were disappointed. Butler was the calmest of all.

“Man, same shit,” Butler said when asked about the team’s mood over the weekend. “We’re fortunate. We get to play basketball every day. We’re in the playoffs. We’re a 3-seed. We’re happy. It could be a lot worse. We could be down 0-4, but we’re not.”

If they were down 0-4, we would have been having a very different conversation with him while the Sixers cleaned out their lockers and headed off into an extremely uncomfortable offseason. But you get his point. On the whole, the Sixers seemed like they were in a pretty good headspace—which does not mean they are without any concerns.

Embiid’s situation has been frustrating for him. For Brown, too. The latter had to answer endless questions about Embiid’s condition in the run-up to the postseason, which made him atypically huffy with reporters. Lately, he’s tried to avoid being Embiid’s health-update point person and instructed us to “please refer” to the official medical sheet distributed by the PR staff. This probably won’t resolve itself anytime soon. People I talked to in the organization said Embiid’s availability moving forward will likely be a day-to-day unknown for however long their postseason lasts. Brown didn’t deny it.

“We’re in a phase, we’re in a stage where we’re buying time,” Brown said. “Can we get a win and buy a few more days? Can we get another win and buy a few more days? We might lose, but we’re alive. Buy three more days. This is just the path we’re on with Joel.”"

With Game 1 raising serious concerns, the Philadelphia 76ers were determined to get a victory in Game 2. After playing a close game through one half, the Sixers exploded in the third quarter, outscoring the Nets 51-23 and cruising to victory.

It was one of the Sixers’ most balanced offensive games since acquiring Tobias Harris, with each starter attempting 12 or fewer shot attempts. Boban Marjanovic led the team with 14 shots, highlighting the free-flowing, unselfish nature that prevailed all game.

The Sixers also stepped up on defense, as Ben Simmons smothered D’Angelo Russell and Joel Embiid effectively deterred shots at the rim. Jimmy Butler was more active on defense as well, continuing to up his intensity.

Now the momentum resides in Philadelphia, a team with more talent and a clear path toward victory in the series. Facing Brooklyn on the road is a challenge, but the Sixers — assuming the proper mentality is maintained — have reestablished themselves a favorites.

Brett Brown made schematic changes that adjusted to Brooklyn’s strengths, forcing Russell out of rhythm and cutting off Joe Harris on the perimeter. The bench rotation, now infused with James Ennis and devoid of the T.J. McConnell–Jonathon Simmons duo, is also better tailored for success.

Perhaps the biggest change between Game 1 and Game 2, however, was the Sixers’ physicality. They bullied the Nets at every opportunity, aggressively attacking the rim and imposing their will on both ends.

Ben Simmons set the tone early, pushing in transition and getting to the rack — an uncommon occurrence in Game 1. If the Sixers want to compete for a title, Simmons needs to perform up to par. Even with questionable free throw shooting, he’s at his best when exploiting mismatches in the post and seeking out contact.

Embiid made similar adjustments, avoiding the three-point line and making a point to attack Brooklyn’s bigs in isolation. Whether it was posting up or off the dribble, Embiid constantly leaned on his impressive paint repertoire, which inevitably led to foul trouble for the Nets. He scored 23 points in 20 minutes.

While Embiid doesn’t need to avoid the three-point line entirely, there’s reason to believe he’s better off limiting his attempts. At 7-foot-2, he’s bigger and stronger than most defenders who oppose him. As long as he avoids turnovers, his ability to exploit those advantages down low represent his most valuable offensive attributes.

The Sixers in general are one of the biggest, most physical teams in the league. Embiid, Simmons, Butler and Harris are all listed at 6-foot-8+. That allows them to create mismatches other teams can’t necessarily prevent — mismatches they need to hunt, embrace and exploit.

Brooklyn thrives on dynamic guard play, but lacks versatile defenders. That’s especially true at the center position, as neither Jarrett Allen nor Ed Davis can defend in space for extended stretches. The only alternatives are Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Jared Dudley, who are undersized for the center position.

The Sixers have the tools to overpower the Nets on brute force alone. As long as Embiid and Simmons are in attack mode and the defense remains engaged and in harmony, it’s difficult to formulate a path to four wins for Brooklyn. Philadelphia’s just too big and too talented."
http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26542700/brooklyn-nets-slow-steady-rebuild-running-ahead-schedule,"T WAS LATE JUNE in 2017, and D'Angelo Russell had settled into a regular offseason routine after his second season with the Los Angeles Lakers. It was a simple schedule: sweat through three separate workouts and return home to relax with a few friends by the pool.

""It was like the same thing, every day, every day,"" Russell said. ""I would leave the house, go train, go to another place, go train, I was doing like three-a-days. And I remember throwing a party, a pool party -- every day, it was a little get-together, me and my boys and stuff -- at my house.

""And mid-pool party -- we're getting barbecue -- I get the phone call.""

It was Russell's agents. They had news of a possible trade.

The destination was unknown but they told him it could be one of the two NBA teams in New York.

""Stay near my phone,"" Russell said of the instructions given to him.

His agents called back a few minutes later, this time with Nets president and general manager Sean Marks on the line. Russell was headed to Brooklyn.

EDITOR'S PICKS

Nets angry over 76ers stars' laughing apology
""I was like, 'Let's go! I'm ready, let's do it!'"" Russell said.

The Nets were coming off a combined 41 wins over the previous two seasons, but Russell was undeterred, excited for a fresh start away from a Lakers franchise -- led by then-president Magic Johnson -- that days later would draft point guard Lonzo Ball No. 2 overall out of UCLA.

""I just knew it was kind of going that way [toward a separation from the Lakers],"" Russell said. ""In this league, when front offices change, you kind of don't have a feel for your future, you know what I'm saying?""

Though Russell changed coasts, the deal sent him from one rebuild to another. And boy were the Nets stuck in theirs -- Brooklyn was lacking the traditional tools for team-building: lottery picks.

Four years before they traded for Russell, the Nets swung big in the now-infamous 2013 trade with the Boston Celtics centered on Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce. It was a franchise-gutting move that resulted in just one playoff series victory and cost Brooklyn three first-rounders and a pick swap that turned into the No. 1 overall selection in 2017 (the pick became Markelle Fultz).

Now, the Nets are back in the playoffs for the first time since an opening-round exit in 2015. And Brooklyn didn't waste any time putting a scare into the third-seeded Philadelphia 76ers, stealing a Game 1 win before a 76ers rout evened the series on Monday.

The Nets remain heavy underdogs, but just playing in mid-April is a testament to a process of their own: savvy roster moves and strong planning and patience from Marks, head coach Kenny Atkinson and the entire organization.

The rest of the NBA has taken notice.

""The staff, the players have all bought in. The system is in there,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""They've slowly but surely built a culture.""

IT WOULD BE EASY for Atkinson to say he always knew the Nets would get to this point, that he never lost faith amid all of the losing. But there were moments in his first season -- a 20-62 slog of a 2016-17 campaign -- when Atkinson had trouble trusting Brooklyn's vision.

""You're just questioning yourself,"" Atkinson said. ""The next day, you're renewed, refreshed and you get back on track, but I have to be honest: There were doubts.""

Marks provided the sounding board Atkinson needed during the franchise's dark times.

""Sean is my stabilizer,"" Atkinson said. ""I'm a little more emotional, going with the ups and downs of the daily season. He's a guy I can vent to, he can counsel me.

""The great thing about Sean: He's been a player, he's management and he's been a coach. He's done scouting. ... He knows what the whole process is like.""

Under former GM Billy King, head coach Lionel Hollins and then interim coach Tony Brown, Brooklyn won only 21 games the season before Atkinson arrived in 2016. The draft had provided little solace (the Nets haven't had a pick better than No. 22 overall since 2010).

With plenty of losing but without any of the high draft picks that came with it, Marks and Atkinson worked with what they did have. It has been a flurry of unheralded moves that slowly turned Brooklyn's fortunes:

Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris signed multiyear, team-friendly minimum contracts in 2016. Prior to Harris signing with the Nets, many NBA front offices questioned whether he belonged in the league at all. Dinwiddie was on his fourth NBA team in three seasons. Both players developed into key contributors under Atkinson and have since re-signed multiyear deals with the club.

""A lot of people thought [Harris] would be a depth player in this league -- probably not a rotation player,"" Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Now he's a starter. He'd be a player that most teams would covet.""

Brooklyn traded Bojan Bogdanovic and Thaddeus Young for packages that returned first-round picks that became Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert, respectively. Young and Bogdanovic are now key players for the Indiana Pacers, but Allen -- eighth in the Eastern Conference in blocks this season as Brooklyn's defensive anchor -- and LeVert have become vital pieces of the Nets' young core.

""A lot of guys have had a similar journey, have a chip on their shoulder,"" Dinwiddie said. ""And [we're] also playing for an organization that really kind of gave you your first real shot in the NBA. That's where I take my pride from.""

Brooklyn wasn't in position to attract top free agents with its cap room, so Marks & Co. used the space to acquire large veteran contracts (Kenneth Faried, DeMarre Carroll and Jared Dudley), forcing teams to attach future draft picks in those deals (two first-round picks and three second-rounders).

The 2017 trade for Russell has certainly been the highest-profile move. Russell, a restricted free agent this summer, blossomed into a first-time All-Star behind career-high averages in points (21.1), assists (7.0) and shooting percentages from the field (43.4) and from deep (36.9)."

Occasionally, during Sean Marks’ first year as Nets general manager, Irina Pavlova would lament about the organization’s current state, regretting the moves of the past that had made it a uniquely misfortunate NBA franchise. Brooklyn was neither of the present or the future then, a 20-win team that could not even sell hope, having dealt away its valuable first-round picks in an ill-conceived trade that netted them a short-term high for a wicked long comedown.

Marks did not. He was fresh, untainted — an executive who was hired to lift the sunken ship from the ocean floor.

https://hoopshype.com/2019/04/14/kemba-walker-free-agent-destinations-landing-spots-mavericks-pacers-knicks/,"One of the best impending free agents who won’t be in the playoffs this season, Kemba Walker will be a top target for multiple teams this summer.

The three-time All-Star point guard is coming off a year in which he averaged 25.6 points, 4.4 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game on 43.4/35.6/84.4 shooting splits. Per Synergy, he ranked in 91st percentile among scorers out of the pick-and-roll and the 83rd percentile in isolation scoring.

Basically, Walker was a walking bucket this year.

And since he’s merely 28 years old, that’ll have teams lining up to sign him on June 1.

Below, we break down four of the most interesting potential landing spots for the supremely confident ball-handler.


DALLAS MAVERICKS
According to a report from the Charlotte Observer’s Rick Bonnell, the biggest threat to lure Walker away from Charlotte are the Dallas Mavericks. In Bonnell’s own words:

“Threats to sign Kemba Walker away from the Charlotte Hornets this summer? Place this team at the top of your list: The Dallas Mavericks. Two sources with knowledge of the Mavericks’ thinking expect Walker, the Hornets’ three-time All-Star point guard, to be that team’s top target when NBA free-agency begins July 1. Although the Mavericks are only 27-39 this season – second-worst record in the Western Conference – they will have both the salary-cap flexibility to offer a free agent a maximum contract this summer and an appealing future to pitch with abundant young talent on the roster.”

The Mavericks’ interest in Walker makes sense, as they could use another stud ball-handler – particularly a star-level one like the Hornets guard – to help share the load with Luka Doncic. Although his numbers are a bit down in that play type, Walker is historically an excellent spot-up shooter, giving him the ability to play off the ball to the young Slovenian forward.

As far as why Walker would be interested in Dallas, perhaps having a teammate of Doncic’s caliber could be appealing to the 28-year-old veteran, since the lack of backcourt help is primarily what has caused the Hornets to miss the playoffs all but twice in the last nine years. Not to mention, a healthy Kristaps Porzingis next season could give the Mavericks a well-rounded three-man nucleus.

Dallas has the money, and the fit makes a whole lot of sense for both parties. Let’s see if preliminary interest becomes something more once free agency opens up this summer.


NEW YORK KNICKS
At one point in the past, it wouldn’t have been farfetched to consider Walker eventually signing with the New York Knicks a very real possibility. After all, Walker hails from the Bronx and has made it no secret the love he has for his hometown.

The thing is, it seems like the Knicks actually have bigger plans for their copious amounts of cap space.

A lot of the buzz as we approach the 2019 playoffs has New York as very real players for the likes of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, who, apparently, could both spurn their current teams in favor of building something new in the Big Apple.

Even so, if the Knicks were to strike out with their top targets, a fallback plan like Walker would make a lot of sense. He’s still in his prime (and will be for the foreseeable future), he’s the hometown guy and he would fill a massive hole at the point-guard spot for New York – a hole that has been around for an inconceivable amount of time.

If Walker wants to get his next deal done by July 4, then the odds of New York swooping in and signing him plummet since Durant and Irving will almost certainly drag their decisions out, and the Knicks won’t do anything with their cap space until they know what the future of those two guys will be.

But if he’s willing to be patient – and the Knicks miss on the two superstars – then this marriage could actually happen.


INDIANA PACERS
There has been next to no buzz tying Walker with the Indiana Pacers, but there’s a few reasons why this surprise pairing could come to fruition.

For one, the Pacers merely owe $60.2 million in salaries next season. With the salary cap projected to be at roughly $109.0 million for 2019-20, that leaves Indiana with quite a bit of spending money.

Furthermore, their starting point guard of the last two seasons, Darren Collison, will be a free agent this summer, leaving the Pacers with a potential hole at the lead-guard spot.

Of course, they could simply choose to re-sign the 31-year-old Collison at what should be a team-friendly price. But if Indiana decides they want to shoot for the stars for an upgrade, Walker could be the perfect target.

With a returning Victor Oladipo, as well as big men Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner, Walker would give the Pacers a fearsome foursome, capable of battling for one of the top spots in the East. And just like with the Dallas hypothetical, Walker may welcome the opportunity to share the floor with a fellow All-Star ball-handler in order to reduce his nightly workload.

This pairing would come out of left field, but Walker-to-Indiana makes a lot more sense the more you think about it."

Kevin Durant scored 38 points in a return to form performance in Game 3 as the Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Clippers.

“This was the first time this season that my actual basketball play, and not about what I’m going to do in the future, took over the headlines,” Durant told Yahoo Sports after Game 3. “Think about that now. That hasn’t happened in a long time. I like that. That’s the way it should be.”

Speculation on Durant's future has dominated headlines this season, particularly after he avoided the media for more than a week and then called out Ethan Strauss of The Athletic. The media, however, has mostly avoided asking Durant questions about his future.

“This game is what it’s all about, not about something that hasn’t even happened,” Durant told Yahoo Sports. “Let’s enjoy basketball. I can take the criticism about the game. This is what we’re paid to do. That should be the focus. This is good.”"

This was going to be a problem, but the more pertinent question now is “what do we do.” Coming into the series, we noted that the Warriors 3rd worst rated defense against the pick and roll was on a collision course with the Clippers and their 2nd highest in the NBA ranked pick and roll attack with Harrell as the finisher.

Williams is averaging just over 30 points and 10 assists per game, many of which go to Harrell and his 25 points per game average over the first two games. Both of those scoring numbers are around 10 points over their season averages, and stemming the bleeding defensively is almost certainly the top priority tonight.

As pointed out above, you can easily identify where the breakdowns are occuring — the question for Golden State will be how effectively they can prevent those secondary breakdowns from happening. This is a great warm up exercise for our hopeful matchup against James Harden and the Rockets, and like a hard kung-fu teacher in an old movie, the Warriors won’t get the chance to move on unless they master this initial test.

What sorts of adjustment will Golden State make?
The number one adjustment will be less dumb turnovers. In a game where the margins were as tight as they were in the previous game, nine turnovers from Durant and four each from Draymond Green and Stephen Curry is just an unacceptably high number. We’ve been hearing this for years, and it’s not a critical flaw (Warriors had 22 turnovers to the Clippers 19) but these are precisely the sort of edge details that define a championship team.

Also, as Sports Illustrated discussed, the Clippers really aren’t doing a great job of slowing down the Warriors offense; But what they are managing to do is bump Durant off of his usual stat line:

It’s hard to describe the scheme as successful—the Dubs’ offensive rating through two games is 115.1, slightly higher than their regular season-leading mark of 114.9. But it does give L.A. a fighting chance, and in Game 2, it helped give Durant fits.

Durant went all the way in yesterday, and broke down the matchup in some detail — as covered by Brady Klopfer for us already in great detail. The most salient detail here is Durant’s description of the coverage, you can read about it via that link (it’s all over the internet too), but let me instead just use a visual example put forth by Anthony Slater of the Athletic. Here’s what Durant is looking at when he catches the ball:

 Necessary context on KD's 8 shot attempts (needs to take more).
1. He's been in pass-first mode for weeks and it had been working for Warriors. 
2. Took game-high 12 free throws. 
3. Clippers scheme designed to get it out of his hands. Overhelping, sending regular doubles.

So please, my fellow Warriors’ fans, don’t besmirch Durant’s good name. He’s making the right decisions. Remember that at least four of his turnovers in the previous game were offensive fouls — trying to push through the play.

Believe it or not, there’s a broader war underway here, and coach Steve Kerr and the rest of the Warriors will have some counters planned for game three.. but that plan is probably not Durant bulling over Beverley for 30 shots.

Here’s Durant’s quip on the solution, as transcribed by Anthony Slater of the Athletic:

We gotta use a couple more movements in order for us to get open on the top-lock. Backdoors might be there. Just continue to move and be patient within the offense. We can kind of move this team for at least 12, 13 seconds until we find something. Then if not, guys can find something, our scorers can go to work.

I expect Durant to be more aggressive, particularly if Beverley continues to press all the way up into his body (which is a foul), but there is definitely a game plan in place to punish the scheme.

Bright side: more Looney
Losing DeMarcus Cousins was a huge blow, both on the court and emotionally. He fully bought into our system, and was starting to look incredibly useful in specific matchups. That’s gone now.

Golden State will instead dust of Andrew Bogut at the start of games — but I’d expect his minutes to be relatively limited. Instead, Kerr and the Warriors are much more likely to go with their proven Hampton’s Five lineup, or perhaps even a lot more of Kevon Looney, who was phenomenal in game two."

 Kevin Durant goes extremely in depth on the Clippers style of defense, the overhelp, why he won’t get caught up in a 1-on-1 battle with Patrick Beverley

The exchange took everything we thought we knew about Durant’s relationship with the media and doused it in lighter fluid. In its place, a phoenix emerged from the ashes, as a thoughtful basketball mind took his time to answer a question in detail. The way Durant broke down his battle with Patrick Beverley is beautiful to watch.

As it turns out, when premier players aren’t caught caught up in free agency or off-court drama and simply want to get to the root of a basketball question, they will provide good answers. Who would’ve thought that?

Durant was asked about Beverley’s defense
Beverley has been one of the most irritating defenders in the NBA his entire career. This postseason, he demanded to be tasked with guarding the league’s (second-) most gifted scorer.

In Game 1, Beverley was so annoying, he and Durant were assessed double technical fouls and ejected in the fourth quarter. In Game 2, Beverley drew multiple offensive fouls that led to Durant fouling out. The Clippers eventually came back from a playoff record 31-point third-quarter deficit to steal a game at Oracle Arena.

The Clippers just pulled off the most important win in franchise history
Durant on Beverley is a mismatch that could — and one can argue should — be exploited every single time. Durant is a seven-footer with guard skills, while Beverley is listed at 6’1. Durant can stand up straight and look right over him. Of course he can shoot over him every trip.

But when asked why he doesn’t, Durant hedged. That’s not fun basketball, he contended. The Warriors had a nice flow to the game. He said he could shoot 43 percent from the field against a pest like Beverley, but what about his teammates? His goal is to win a game.

“When I get the ball in my spots, well, I’ve got a pest, Patrick Beverley, who’s up underneath me,” he said. “Well I could definitely shoot over the top and score every time if it’s a 1-on-1 situation. But we’ve got a guy that’s dropping and helping, and we’ve got another guy that’s sitting on me, waiting for me to dribble the basketball. If I put the basketball on the floor, I can probably make 43 percent of my shots if I shoot them like that. But that’s not really gonna do anything for us with the outcome of the game, ‘cause we’ve got a nice flow. Everybody’s touching the rock, and everybody’s shooting and scoring.”

The moment showed a new side to Durant, one that is rarely seen by the public. His response went viral on social media, the same way a cryptic quote about free agency might. Hell, I’m even writing about it right now.

“So I’m not gonna get in the way of the game because I wanna have a little back-and-forth with Patrick Beverley. I’m Kevin Durant. You know who I am. Y'all know who I am.”

The gem of that quote was at the end
“I’m Kevin Durant. You know who I am. Y’all know who I am.”

Durant knows he could get a basket whenever he wants. He knows, if he really wanted to, he could shred the Clippers’ defense to pieces and shoot a respectable field goal percentage doing so. He knows he’s in a different stratosphere than Beverley.

Yet Durant still respects Beverley’s craft:

“When he runs up on me, and grabs me and holds me. I don’t mind it,” he said later. “That’s how he makes his money. That’s how he feeds his family. But if I throw something back, then let us play.”

Some basketball players don’t want to talk Xs and Os. They’d rather talk about how difficult it is to find clothes that fit, or how they’ve changed their diet over the years.

But others, like Durant, don’t mind answering questions about the actual game when in the right mood, as long as the questions aren’t stupid.

Moral of the story: don’t ask a dumb question and you might learn something."
https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-clippers-report-20190417-story.html,"Two of the Clippers’ rookie guards have developed chemistry in a short period of time together, the proof of that on display in a crucial moment when Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet worked in unison to provide their team with the shot heard around the NBA.

It all started with veteran Lou Williams showing he had confidence in the 20-year-old Gilgeous-Alexander to make the right play in Game 2 of the first-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors at raucous Oracle Arena on Monday night.

Williams found himself being double-teamed by guards Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry when the game hung in the balance. Williams passed the basketball to a wide-open Gilgeous-Alexander, who penetrated into the lane before he encountered the defensive presence of forward Andre Iguodala.

Gilgeous-Alexander did not panic. He looked over at the wing and passed the basketball between the long arms of Iguodala to a waiting Shamet, who set his feet and drilled a three-pointer with forward Draymond Green running at him.

The ball settled into the net with 16.5 seconds left, giving the Clippers a 133-131 lead that soon would turn into a wild celebration of a 135-131 victory, the largest comeback in NBA playoff history.

And the two rookies, Gilgeous-Alexander and Shamet, were right in the middle of all that joy.

“He’s a really cerebral player,” Shamet said about Gilgeous-Alexander before practice Wednesday in preparation for Game 3 against the Warriors on Thursday night at Staples Center. “For playing one year in college, he’s super cerebral, understands the game, understands his reads.

“Him and I are starting to figure each other out. He made the perfect read. Iggy came over and helped, he threw it to me. I still don’t know how he got it too me. Hell of a pass. But, I love playing with Shai. He’s an unselfish guy. He’s aggressive, looks to get his own, but also understands when and where to get other guys involved. So, he’s been great.”

Gilgeous-Alexander had been with the Clippers all season, but Shamet didn’t join the Clippers until he was acquired on Feb. 6 as a part of the Tobias Harris trade.


Clippers' series with Golden State is tied, but they know playing better in Game 3 is critical
APR 17, 2019 | 4:10 PM
It didn’t take long for the 6-foot-5 Shamet, a dynamic shooting guard, and the 6-6 Gilgeous-Alexander, a rangy point guard, to bond.

“It’s just getting to know each other, playing with each other, practice, games,” Shamet said. “It’s just simply being around each other, being put in those situations.

“We’ll talk about things here and there. The things he’ll see, he’ll say, ‘Hey, do this next time.’ I’ll say, ‘Hey, yo, on this play I’m right here.’ We talk, go back and forth. We have a good open relationship where he can tell me things, I can tell him things and it’s only going to grow.”

In their first two playoff games, Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging 11.0 points, 3.0 assists and 2.5 rebounds in 33 minutes while Shamet is averaging 7.5 points, 2.5 assists and 2.0 rebounds in 26.5 minutes.

“They are going to be so much better in a year than they are now,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. “Shai is going to be able to help Sham even be better just by looking for him in the transition, getting him the ball when he’s open instead of after he’s open. That just takes time. But that will come.”

Clippers turn up heat on defense

During the regular season, the Clippers were not known as a team that made a lot of steals.

But after the first two games of the playoffs, the Clippers are leading the NBA in steals at 12.0 per game.

During the season, they averaged just 6.8 steals per game, tying the New York Knicks for 23rd in the league."

THE WARRIORS INSIDER PODCAST

OAKLAND – With teammates and coaches urging him to be more assertive with his shot, Kevin Durant says he knows what the Warriors need from him and how best to deliver it, regardless of the “gimmicky” defense of the Clippers.

The gimmick Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers threw at Durant in Games 1 and 2 is mostly in the form of relentlessly pesky guard Patrick Beverley.

“I’m not going get in the way of the game because I want to have a little back-and-forth with Patrick Beverley,” Durant said after practice Wednesday.

“I’m Kevin Durant. You know who I am. Y’all know who I am.”

Durant is an MVP and a four-time scoring champion. He averaged 26 points per game in the regular season and averages 27 for his 12 NBA seasons. He scored 21 points on 16 shots in Game 1 and then 23 on eight shots in Game 2. 

The Warriors, aware that Durant’s attempt rate diminished greatly over the final weeks of the season – he averaged 10.8 shots over the final nine games, 17.6 over the previous nine – would like to see those numbers go up in the playoffs, beginning with Game 3 on Thursday in LA.

Because he’s such an accomplished and efficient scorer, more movement and aggression should mean more shots for Durant. That subject has been addressed with Durant, according to coach Steve Kerr.

“The guy is the most skilled basketball player on planet earth,” Kerr said. “There’s nobody who can do what he can do. It’s the playoffs. Defenses are more locked in. They play everybody tougher. I don’t know how many shots he got the other night. Seven? Eight? Absolutely, he needs to be more aggressive. It’s the playoffs. He can get any shot he wants, any time.

“So I want to see him get 20 shots. Thirty.”

Though he has a nine-inch height advantage over Beverley, Durant points out that is somewhat deceptive because the Clippers usually send at least one other defender his way.

“When I get the ball and I’m in position to score, I will look to score,” Durant said. “But if I don’t have an option to score, I will look to pass. We run a lot of plays here. We move the ball every time downcourt, so every time I touch it, I’m not going to break a play just to be aggressive just because I need to get up 30 shots. Because it would look like something is wrong with me.

“I’m going to play basketball. We won Game 1 that way. We were up 30 in Game 2. I think we should just stick to the game plan we had the first two-and-a-half quarters and do that for 48 minutes.”

Durant has a point. As the Warriors built a 31-point lead midway through the third quarter, he was relatively passive with his shot.

“I’m not going to go out there and just go shoot 20 or 30 shots,” he said. “I don’t play like that. When we were up 30 points, I had five shots. Everybody’s shots were evenly distributed around that time, so me taking two more shots after that is not the reason why we lost.”

This, too, is true. The more visible problem for the Warriors – and for Durant – was the number of turnovers. Durant committed four in the third quarter and two more in the fourth as the Clippers chipped away at the deficit until they took the lead and the game.

[RELATED: KD needs to be resuscitated, and only Steph has the power]

Yet there never is a situation where the most efficient scorer shouldn’t take advantage of his matchup. Beverley, as disruptive as he is, can’t contain KD. And if Beverley gets help, KD passes well enough to burn that strategy.

Durant’s decision to be more selective than assertive with his shot can work. But the Warriors want to see him go to work. They would accept more production now, and they’re going to need it as they go deeper into the postseason."
https://theathletic.com/930878/2019/04/17/the-kevin-rules-on-durant-vs-clippers-strategy/,"In the late 1980s through early 1990s, the Detroit Pistons used “The Jordan Rules” on His Airness. It was a novel-yet-brutal strategy, with tactics both physical and psychological. Eventually, Michael Jordan harnessed what was needed to overcome an entire team’s burning focus and a legend was born.

Every postseason since brings its own “Rules” incarnation, deployed against a superstar. In the 2016 Finals, Cavs coaches had a mantra when it came to Steph Curry: “Get a touch on that motherfucker, every time.” That didn’t mean anything dirty per se, but the Cavs wanted Curry to feel them on each and every possession. So Steph would be screened on the defensive end, hard, repeatedly, to serve the general war of attrition.

Though he’d faced specific, pointed tactics as a member of the Thunder, Kevin Durant has mostly escaped such spotlighting as a Warrior. This is a compliment, in a way. So few players can credibly guard KD that coaches spend...

https://hashtagbasketball.com/los-angeles-clippers/content/shai-gilgeous-alexander-clippers-best-kept-secret,"It's hard to understand what a 6'11 wingspan looks like in person. The most helpful way might be to imagine someone standing at the back of a large SUV, spreading their arms out into prime T-pose, and their arms extending past the width of the vehicle. 

SUVs are large vehicles. 

Have you ever played basketball against one? I haven't, and I hope I never do. How hard would it be to pass around waving tendrils spanning the width of a tank disguised as soccer mom transportation? 

And yet here we stand: digitally face to face with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the man with a Chevrolet Suburban wingspan who can't even buy a beer. Which is sad, considering he's got lots to celebrate given his strong rookie season. 

SGA's physical measures often define him, but his game denies them. The long and lanky point guard plays like someone who doesn't have physical tools. He's a cerebral player, which sets him up to have a unique 1-2 punch of strengths: size and smarts. Players who have one don't often exercise the other, and rarely do we see players who use both so well. 

Based on what we know, here are the things we talk about with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: His length, his intelligence, his low turnover rate. There is one little blip in his skill set that gets little attention. The lack of attention is proportional to its lack of prevalence, which is by design. The Clippers don't call many plays that, statistically speaking, use his best skill set. 

Here's the secret: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is one of the best isolation scorers in the league. Right now. As a rookie.

Per Synergy Sports, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scores 1.06 points per possession in isolation situations, which is better than 87% of the league. And I don't want to hurt you, but here's a list of people he's ranked ahead of: 

Kevin Durant
Kahwi Leonard
Kemba Walker
DeMar DeRozan
Jimmy Butler
Kyrie Irving
Lebron James
The smart and seasoned of your number will cry out, weeping: ""SMALL SAMPLE SIZE!!"" And you are correct! SGA is, by no means, a better isolation scorer than those players. They have much higher rates of isolation situations, and with volume, efficiency will begin to deflate. Only 5% of Gilgeous-Alexander's possessions are isolations.

But here's the question: What if he had more? And how does his length help him score?

Isolation


That length helps. This is not intended to be blasphemous in any way, but Gilgeous-Alexander has shades of Giannis. Watch this drive. He, like Giannis, uses his elite Suburban-like length to keep the ball far away from defenders. Even in traffic, SGA easily shields the ball from defenders and finishes at an unconventional angle, all because he's got arms like pool noodles.



You gotta feel sorry for the Cavaliers, being used twice in a row in this article.

The clip above is extra impressive. Gilgeous-Alexander does his best Jason Williams impression, but the finish is key. Even though Nance Jr. is hot on his tail, Shai still uses his inside hand, the one closest to the defender, to finish. He's able to do that because he can get the ball far enough in front of himself that he can use his own body as a shield without worrying. His length gives him the ability to guard his own shots against defenders with ease.



Without question, having flailing tendrils for arms lets you slam home the most efficient shot in basketball more frequently. When ""shades of Giannis"" was mentioned, does this do it for you?



This is huge. Gilgeous-Alexander does a couple of things here. First, Rudy Gobert is in the perfect position to defend this play, and SGA doesn't care one bit. He has some sort of quiet confidence in him that wills him forward. Second, Gilgeous-Alexander makes his length his greatest weapon, nullifying Gobert's own length, and finishes around Rudy. It's not a pretty finish, but not many players at his position could even attempt that, much less make it. His length gives him the ability to be more creative when he chooses.

Conclusion
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is playing quietly behind the stars of his class: Trae Young, Luka Doncic, and Deandre Ayton. It shouldn't be this way. As far as rookies are concerned, the go-go-gadget arm sporting Clipper is a unique kind of player. He's long and athletic, cool, calm, and collected, and he's doing impressive work when left to fend for himself.

But it isn't happening enough. What would happen if Doc Rivers let SGA have 5-7 more possessions per game in isolation? Were Gilgeous-Alexander's 1.06 points per possession to hold given the uptick, he could easily average 15-17 points a game as a rookie.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has a bright future. And while the others may get the glory, he'll be getting difficult buckets."
https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2019/04/18/triple-team-jazz-were/,"Jazz didn’t respond to Houston’s defensive tone
I’m not big on cliches like “setting the tone.” Most of the time, setting the tone early just means you just made some shots early, or you have better players than the other team, or your coach drew up a great play, or something like that. “Setting the tone” is this intangible thing, something we use to explain what happened without having to get into the nitty gritty of what actually happened.

But from the very beginning of the game, the Rockets were into the Jazz defensively, and the Jazz responded by doing nothing about it. The Jazz had a turnover nine seconds into the game: Joe Ingles gets bodied up as he tries to drive, and ends up losing the ball out of bounds.

On the next play, Ingles comes late on the rotation, and it’s a Clint Capela lob. That’s a lack of focus, to be sure.


So I think the Jazz tried the same play on the next one, and this time, Ingles stops short. Ingles has to reset to Mitchell who has to create with no advantage, and dribbles the ball off his foot. Weirdly, Mitchell doesn’t really go after the loose ball with any energy, then once Eric Gordon does get it, Mitchell grabs his hip for no reason as Gordon tries to score. And-one.


The Jazz had two days to stew about the Game 1 loss, and this is the result? They talked about how they needed to nail their rotations, how they needed to play with force on the offensive end, and they talked about how tough they wanted to make life for the Rockets to get to their spots. And instead they came out and did exactly none of it. They lost the first quarter 39-19. That 20-point deficit was also the final margin in the game.

“They’re playing more aggressive than we are. We’re a little too nice. If you’re going to be nice, you’re going to get your ass kicked every night,"" Rudy Gobert said. It’s just mental. We can say whatever we want, but if we’re too nice, they’re not going to respect us. They’re going to kick our ass.”

Quotes like this are promising, and they’re more pointed than what the players said after Game 1. But now they’re down 2-0 in the series, and will need to win four of their next five against a team that hasn’t lost four games in two months. It’s not quite too late, but it’s close.

2. Donovan Mitchell scored 11 points
Look, this game is not all or even mostly Donovan Mitchell’s fault. A lot of players had bad nights: Joe Ingles, Jae Crowder, Thabo Sefolosha, Kyle Korver, etc. But the truth is that it’s reasonable to hold Mitchell to a higher standard because of the skill he’s shown in his young career so far, including in the playoffs last season.

Mitchell wasn’t good enough, though. He only scored 11 points on 5-of-19 shooting, and while he did get six assists — much better than Game 1′s zero assist performance — he added four turnovers and five fouls on the defensive end.

“I didn’t show up. Simply put. That can’t happen,” he said.

Mitchell is typically hard on himself after losses like this, but again there was a difference between Game 1′s acceptance and Game 2′s anger.

This play was among the worst. Mitchell gets the ball and Danuel House is guarding him. House isn’t a great defender, but he’s not terrible, so this is a bit of a strange mismatch to try to exploit. But Mitchell tries to, and goes to his own step-back jump shot, or in other words, he settles.


Oh, and then the Jazz are forced to play transition defense, which they screw up, and Eric Gordon gets a wide open three.

We talked about this in Sunday’s Triple Team, but he does just have to attack sooner, or call for another screen. The Jazz’s offense is built around “advantage basketball,"" to get an advantage and continue to widen it until it’s an easy shot. Despite some time, Mitchell never got an advantage, then throws up the shot to end the possession. It’s not great.

“I’ll probably watch the game four or five times. I did the same thing after Game 1,"" Mitchell said. ""But I just have to show up, man. That’s all I’ve got. I could watch film for the next three days, but I’ve got to do it. That’s it.”

3. Defense on Harden
The Jazz went to a variance strategy on James Harden in Game 2: they tried the Game 1 look of forcing him to Gobert, but mixed in some more standard defense as well. And perhaps just as important, they changed up primary defenders to give him some more looks.

And it didn’t really matter. If you stay in front of Harden, he will do this to you.

The Jazz still limited him to five free-throws, which is pretty good. But you absolutely can’t do this while defending him, which might be one reason Sefolosha’s minutes were replaced with Georges Niang minutes in the late third quarter.

Still: 32 points on 11-24 shooting plus eight turnovers is not too shabby against Harden, actually. And the defense only gave up 94.4 points per 100 possessions in half-court scenarios, which is decent enough. It’s just that the Jazz can’t score, so there are a ton of transition chances for the Rockets to take advantage of.

“It doesn’t matter what we do as far as schemes go if we don’t have that intensity and that effort. Coach can draw up a great game plan, which I think he has, and we just haven’t executed it well,” Mitchell said.

The chances to do so are rapidly dwindling.

The Houston Rockets blew out the Utah Jazz for the second straight game, 118-98, on Wednesday night. That means they have now outscored the Jazz by 52 points in the two games, neither of which was ever close.

In the commanding wins, James Harden is proving why he should be MVP, P.J. Tucker and Eric Gordon are shooting well, Kenneth Faried and Austin Rivers are showing they can be serviceable in the postseason, and everything seems to be going right. Chris Paul and Clint Capela haven’t played better than average, and the Rockets still look terrifying.

That leaves the question: could this Rockets team be as good or even better than the last one?

RELATED

Your clever schemes are useless against James Harden
Whoa, the Rockets look even more powerful than we thought
Houston’s season has been filled with ups and downs that’ve swayed their public perception. Paul missed 24 games during the regular season to injury and suspension, Capela also missed 15 games to injury, many of which came after Paul healed. Thus, the Rockets identity became The James Harden one-man team.

Fans and media (fairly) harped on the team’s decision to not re-sign Trevor Ariza or Luc Mbah A Moute and criticized the poor decision of trying to fill their void with Carmelo Anthony, who only lasted 10 games with the team.

But even through all of that muck, Houston finished fifth in the league in adjusted net rating, a stat that estimates point differential per 100 possessions. That’s better than the Sixers, Nuggets, Trail Blazers, Celtics, and Thunder. They won 53 games, just four fewer than the Warriors. And Harden might be playing even better ball than his MVP season.

It’s time to take the Rockets seriously.
With DeMarcus Cousins out for the rest of the postseason for the Warriors, the Bucks without Malcolm Brogdon, at least for now, the Nuggets looking beatable against the Spurs, and the Thunder down a sizable 2-0 to Portland, Houston has emerged within the title-hopeful mix.

The Rockets have taken their historic offense from a year ago, and reached another level. Even through the injuries, this year’s team has somehow found a way to take 251 more three-point shots than the last and only shoot half a percentage point worse. They’ve taken just 60 fewer free throws, but made one percent more of them. Overall, their offense is outscoring opponents by one point per 100 possessions more than they did last year, which ranks second to only the Warriors by a fraction of a point.

Two games into the playoffs, that’s persisted. With so many threats from distance, an alley-oop finisher in Capela, two of the league’s best-ever point guards handling the ball, and ample backups like Danuel House Jr., Rivers, and Faried, the Rockets have a full-fledged team ready to compete with the best. That’s something that didn’t feel possible over the summer.

Rockets runaway in Game 2 with 118-98 victory over the Jazz
The Rockets’ defense is what will make or break them.
One side of the ball could hold them back, though it hasn’t just yet. While Houston’s offense improved this year, its defense has taken a backseat. The Rockets allowed 4.35 more points per 100 possessions this season than they did last, partially due to injuries from their best defensive big man and most capable on-ball perimeter defender.

So far, so good, but Utah isn’t the team to test Houston’s defensive capabilities. The Jazz ranked in the bottom half of the league in offense during the regular season, and nothing’s changed in the playoffs. They’re shooting the fourth-worst percentage from the field at 39.4 percent and an ugly 23 percent from range.

Should the series shake out as we suspect, Houston would face Golden State in round two, and that’s where its limit would be tested. Can P.J. Tucker and Eric Gordon keep up with Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant with Ariza absent? Can Paul contain Steph Curry? Is Capela’s presence sans Cousins be as meaningful?

But with Houston’s offense looking as terrifying as it does now, the Warriors have to at least be a little bit worried. Houston was one half and one 27-straight three-point miss streak away from falling short of the Finals to this team a year ago. Now, they’re back, and possibly better than ever."

The Magic’s All-Star center has been silenced by Marc Gasol and the Toronto Raptors

Shortly before Orlando traded for Markelle Fultz in February, another trade took place that would ultimately have a much greater impact this season on the Magic.

The Raptors traded Jonas Valanciunas to Memphis for Marc Gasol. Now two-and-a-half months later, Gasol is playing a large role in potentially bringing the Magic’s season to an end.

The former Defensive Player of the Year, in his tenth season, remains a defensive master who uses his positioning, anticipation and physicality to his advantage. Evan at 34 years old, and a step slower than he once was, he has silenced Nikola Vucevic in the opening two games of the first round series between the Magic and Raptors.

The Magic’s inside-out offense all season has run through Vucevic, with any possession where the ball fails to enter the paint and reach his hands being considered something of a failure in the eyes of Steve Clifford. That offensive philosophy helped transform Vucevic into a first-time All-Star who averaged 20.8 points and 12.0 rebounds per game while shooting 51.8 percent from the field.

That All-Star, and those numbers, has gone missing in this series.

Gasol and the Raptors, in two games this series, have caused a sharp drop in Vucevic’s production, and seemingly, his confidence. That has left the Magic scrambling - and failing - to find offense.

Gasol has bodied Vucevic out of position down low to force him away from the basket, and used aggressive ball denial to prevent entry passes that had been second nature to Orlando all season. When Vucevic does receive the ball, he is being suffocated with double teams from the weak side that have immobilized him, robbing him of his ability to operate in the post.

He has shot 6-for-21 in the first two games of the series, averaging 8.5 points om 28.6 percent shooting. More concerning is that he attempted just seven shots in Game 2, far below his season average of 16.9 per game. That has resulted from a combination of the Magic being unable to consistently deliver an entry pass to an out-of-position Vooch; Vucevic, when he does get the ball, being unable to overcome the physicality of Gasol and the help defense to even get a shot off; and/or Vucevic either rushing his attempts or being too hesitant to shoot at all. Even simply passing the ball was a challenge as Vooch committed a team-high four turnovers in Game 2, truly giving this a Monstars-stealing-talent-in-Space-Jam type of feel.

For All-Star caliber players, more is typically expected of them in the postseason as teams shorten their rotations and lean on their most reliable. Yet, Vucevic’s usage rate has dropped from 28.0 percent in the regular season to 21.7 percent in the first two games of the playoffs.

And most concerning of all is that Vucevic and Clifford don’t seem to have any solutions.

“I actually thought tonight I got the ball in decent spots in the post the few times that I did, it’s just that they double-teamed me early and it’s hard for me to create anything,” Vucevic told reporters after the game. “They do a good job taking away a lot of my strengths. I just got to figure it out, a way to be more aggressive, be more efficient offensively. I didn’t take many shots either tonight. So, I just gotta find a way to get going offensively.”

 NBA: Playoffs-Orlando Magic at Toronto Raptors
John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports
Clifford said after Game 1 that he had to get the ball to Vucevic in more advantageous situations. After Game 2, he said the Raptors double-teamed Vucevic early in the post and the Magic didn’t handle it well, and that Orlando didn’t get much out of the pick-and-roll due to poor coordination between the ball handler and screener.

“My experience in a series like this, the best players - and I believe he’s been our best player all year, he’s a very, very good player - there’s just certain things they figure out as a series goes on,” Cliffors said. “Sometimes there’s things you can help them with and sometimes they have to figure out. He’s a bright guy, he’s a very good player and I think he’ll figure this out.”

That’s easier said than done for a player like Vucevic who has never responded well to physical play, which happens to be one of Gasol’s strengths. In 11 regular season games against Gasol since coming to Orlando, Vucevic has been limited to 13.5 points per game on 45 percent shooting. Nick Nurse credited Gasol’s basketball IQ and physical nature for the Raptors’ defense on Vucevic.

“The biggest thing you’ve got to do, not with Vucevic, but with any really good post player, is try to push the catches out far away from the basket so they’re starting from a point farther away so they’re less comfortable,” Nurse said. “The percentages obviously go down the further away you can keep ’em. I just think he played him real physical, played him real smart, didn’t give him anything real easy.”

By doing so, and essentially negating Vucevic, the Raptors have removed the focal point of the Magic’s offensive system, leaving them to sputter along like a car with a dying engine. The Magic, in the first two games of the series, have struggled to get into their offensive sets, have shot just 38.6 percent and committed 28 turnovers.

Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports
So what is the solution?

Vucevic certainly won’t become a more physical player overnight, but he has to find a way to establish position down low and stand his ground against Gasol. Beating the double teams will depend on Vucevic’s teammates proving that they are consistent threats from the outside, namely Jonathan Isaac, who is shooting 33 percent in the series and has made just one of his 10 three-point attempts Until that happens, the Raptors will continue to send their lengthy help defenders to double, stuff the paint on Vucevic, and dare the Magic to shoot.

Clifford said he will look at all possible adjustments, but also placed responsibility on Vucevic.

“He’s going to have to find a way to get easy ones, whether it’s running the floor more, being more active on the offensive glass, duck ins, whatever it is, so he can get the ball deeper,” Clifford said. “A coach’s responsibility is to put guys in a position where they can play best. But also, players have to figure some things out on their own also.”

He’ll have a chance to do so in the friendly confines of the south, as the Magic return to Orlando to host their first playoff game since 2012.

There Vucevic will have to figure it out in Game 3, and regain All-Star form, for the Magic to have a chance in the series.

“I expected this,” Vucevic said. “I expected them to have a big focus on me. So, I just gotta look at the tape and look at what we can do better. We have two days now before we play, so we’ll figure out a way.”"

The Raptors’ boom-or-bust NBA title pursuit hinges on one big bet

By Ben Golliver
April 18
The inherent risk of the Toronto Raptors’ daring vision took just one playoff game to manifest — at the worst possible time, no less.

With 10 seconds left in Game 1 and the score tied, Orlando Magic guard D.J. Augustin surveyed from the top of the key. Directly in front of him: Kawhi Leonard. Slightly to his left: Marc Gasol. As the veteran point guard probed and used a soft screen from Nikola Vucevic, the Raptors’ formidable defensive duo momentarily lost its wits.

Leonard followed Vucevic. A beat later, Gasol followed Vucevic, too. Another moment later, Augustin stepped into a wide-open three-pointer to give Orlando the win. Gasol and Leonard looked at each other after the ball swished through. Their simultaneous shrugged shoulders and upward palms shouted, “What were you doing?”

Blown assignments in big moments happen, but this one was remarkable because it featured two defensive players of the year renowned for their high IQ, well-honed instincts and years of deep playoff runs. This wasn’t a failure of knowledge or physical ability but of chemistry and cohesion. Entering the playoffs, the Raptors’ two high-profile hired guns had played together in just 19 games since Gasol arrived by trade in February.

Together, Leonard and Gasol are emblematic of both the Raptors’ ambition and their newness. Despite winning a franchise-record 59 games last season, Toronto fired coach of the year Dwane Casey, traded away beloved all-star guard DeMar DeRozan and replaced four members of its starting five. Those changes, highlighted by Leonard’s arrival in a blockbuster trade in July, ushered in a new life cycle for a franchise that spent its first 20 years fighting for respect and the past five in the shadow of LeBron James. Loaded like never before, Toronto is still figuring itself out.

“We want to win the title this year,” Raptors General Manager Bobby Webster said by telephone on the eve of the playoffs. “We’ve put a lot of the pieces in place to be prepared for that. As an organization, when you first get to the playoffs, everyone is happy to be there. You go a couple of times, and now the expectation is to make it every year. Then you get close [by making the 2016 East finals], and the expectation becomes to compete for a title. That’s just where our organization is.”

If the opening loss to Orlando revealed the speed bumps that can arise during a full-throttle retooling effort, Game 2 served as proof of concept for a team searching for its first NBA Finals appearance. Despite early foul trouble, Leonard delivered one of the most dominant playoff performances in Raptors history, pouring in 37 points on 15-for-22 shooting to key a 111-82 blowout victory.

The 27-year-old forward’s effortless scoring contrasted sharply with DeRozan’s pained and panicky work in years past, and his even-keeled demeanor is a helpful base for an organization that has struggled to keep its composure during pressure-packed moments. After all-star point guard Kyle Lowry triggered painful memories of playoff letdowns with a scoreless Game 1, for example, Leonard didn’t blink.

“[Lowry] played well in [Game 2],” Leonard said of his teammate’s 22 points and seven assists. “He made shots. That’s [the only thing] he didn’t do in Game 1. He made shots and led us in intensity. He did a great job of bouncing back. He’s a pro. That’s what pros do.”

What makes the Raptors so fascinating — and so tricky to forecast — is that Leonard serves as their primary stabilizing force and their chief destabilizer. The 2014 Finals MVP brings championship credentials and steely nerves, but he also has required significant accommodations. With his free agency looming this summer and a quadriceps injury that cost him all but nine games last year, the Raptors agreed to a careful “load management” program for their superstar.

As a result, Leonard played in just 60 games, down more than 10 games from his two all-star seasons with the San Antonio Spurs, and logged more than 40 minutes just four times this year. (By comparison, Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal did so 22 times this season.) To help prepare Leonard for the intensity of the playoffs, Toronto elected to play him in its final five regular season games even though its seed was effectively determined.

“We had to remind ourselves of the big picture, which is the playoffs and Kawhi’s health,” Webster said. “He’s been ramping up with the playoffs in mind. There’s no flipping a switch.”

The conservative strategy inspired some grumbles from fans and media observers, but it achieved its primary goal: Leonard, who averaged career highs of 26.6 points and 7.3 rebounds to go with 3.3 assists per game, is ready for May and June.

“[Leonard] is able to play as many [minutes] as he wants,” first-year coach Nick Nurse said after Game 2. “He can handle as many [minutes] as the game calls for. He looks a little bouncier out there.”

Leonard’s load management created opportunities for the likes of Pascal Siakam, a third-year forward who thrilled Toronto’s brass with his night-to-night consistency and emerged as a most improved player candidate. More than anything, though, it enabled Nurse to put his stamp on the team.

The hoops lifer, whose unorthodox background includes stops in the English professional ranks and the minor leagues in Iowa, is accustomed to improvising his lineups and strategies. Toronto posted a stellar 17-5 record in games that Leonard missed, a testament to its depth and Nurse’s command. The Raptors also ranked in the top five in clutch situations, an impressive feat given its many new faces and the coaching change.

Between their steady play and Leonard’s reticence with the media, the Raptors have largely avoided the free agency scrutiny generated by superstars such as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. That has been helpful because President Masai Ujiri and Webster are set for a busy summer. In addition to Leonard, who is reportedly a top target of the Los Angeles Clippers, Gasol and sharpshooting guard Danny Green could be free agents. Lowry and big man Serge Ibaka, meanwhile, have one more year remaining on their current deals.

Toronto’s bold title-chasing gambits therefore have a boom-or-bust feel, and the chatter around its key pieces could pick up as the playoffs unfold.

“[Leonard’s free agency] hasn’t been a distraction, and I don’t think it will be a distraction,” Webster said. “When these guys say they will make the decision in the summer, it’s completely truthful and you want to respect it. [Our players] have incredible laser focus, and thinking about your next job and letting your mind wander doesn’t do you a lot of good.”

Despite the longer-term questions, the Raptors’ immediate outlook is extraordinarily promising. They ranked second in wins, third in point differential, sixth in offensive efficiency and fourth in defensive efficiency during the regular season. Their roster includes a top-10 centerpiece, multiple supporting stars and impressive lineup flexibility.

James’s move out of the Eastern Conference is no trivial matter, either. Since 2016, the Raptors lost all three of their series against his Cleveland Cavaliers but won all four of their other series. Toronto’s boogeyman is out of the playoffs altogether this season, with James’s Los Angeles Lakers having failed to qualify for the postseason.

To cast Toronto as the East favorite would be overly generous, given the rise of MVP front-runner Giannis Antetokounmpo and the consistent excellence of the Milwaukee Bucks. Yet the major developments from the past 12 months — James’s departure from the East, Nurse’s hiring, Leonard’s arrival and the Raptors’ health — have broken perfectly. For once, Toronto enters the playoffs on its own terms.

“There was more relief felt on July 2 than there is now,” Webster said, referencing the date that James signed with the Lakers. “I don’t think [the LeBron factor] is weighing on anybody’s psyche. I’m not sure we’ve talked about that internally for months. We’re meshing and jelling really well right now. There’s not a ton of focus on the past.”

Kawhi Leonard and Marc Gasol provide the kind of adult energy the Raptors have been searching for in the playoffs for years. In Game 2, the value of the team’s two new fatherly souls was on display.

Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY Sports
It wouldn’t be fair to suggest past editions of the Raptors lacked leadership. Dwane Casey was the ultimate figurehead, the spire around which an entire era of Toronto basketball was built. DeMar DeRozan had charisma. Revered by his teammates for his hard work and knack for buckets, all the while serving as fan liaison both in good times and bad. Few dudes have or will ever carry that kind of gravitas in Toronto. Even DeRozan’s surly sidekick, Kyle Lowry, while usually mum for the cameras, can’t be accused of being a passenger.

But five playoff runs ranging from uneven to Wizards taught us all something about the construction of the Raptors. Even with all those de facto leaders, there never existed a singular pyramid-topper who could unite the entire squad and provide it with direction when times were lean. Basically, the Raptors needed someone to play the role of dad.

Masai Ujiri spent the last year working to fill that paternal hole with his shrewd, often unpopular dealings. In the third quarter of Game 2 against the Magic on Tuesday, it became clear — if it wasn’t already — that he had succeeded in his search. In fact, it seems Ujiri found the Raptors not just one, but a pair of new father figures.

Kawhi Leonard and Marc Gasol boast all the traits a strong parental unit’s gotta have, all of which were on display in Game 2 against the Magic. The third quarter stands as their most comprehensive parenting clinic to date.

Parents have to be steady under pressure. Toronto was facing plenty of it, as is customary, over the two agonizingly days between the Game 1 loss and Tuesday’s chance to even the series. The Raptors weren’t exactly white-knuckling at the end of the first half in Game 2, but the game still had a touch of wobble to it.

Leonard and Danny Green were stuck on three fouls through 24 minutes, and Toronto’s 51-39 cushion felt a tad phoney considering the Magic’s ghastly first half from the free-throw line (8-of-16). A little bit of a gusto from Orlando out of the gate and the nerves and looming diarrhea of Game 1 would have come rushing back.

In less than three minutes, however, Leonard and Gasol all but ensured the Game 2 result would be much smoother on Toronto’s collective intestinal tract — Kawhi with his silky brutishness, Gasol with his guttural defensive commands and thumping, freeing screens on the other end.

Toronto’s fatherly duo combined to score the opening 11 points of the quarter, each slinging one assist to the other, and winning that three-minute skirmish 11-6. Any illusions of an Orlando comeback were quickly exposed as mirage.

All the more impressive was that Kawhi steadied the ship while negotiating foul trouble, with Marc Davis and his eager whistle glaring away on the baseline, no less. He’d been coping with three fouls on his ledger since early in the second quarter. And in a truly shocking turn of events, he remained calm about it.

“Just can’t be as aggressive as I want to on the defensive end, so really just trying to play as perfect as possible,” said Leonard of how he responded to picking that third foul. Apparently playing perfectly is just a thing he can decide to do when the mood strikes.

“Just getting to spots early and just making sure I don’t reach and get a cheap one. That’s all I can do,” Leonard added. “I don’t foul as much during the regular season, and just kept trying to play my game.”

Any strong set of parents has symbiosis; Kawhi playing ‘his game’ on Tuesday was in large part tied to Gasol.

As Zach Lowe alluded to in his pre-Game 2 primer for ESPN, the Raptors didn’t really lean on the pick-and-roll or pick-and-pop in Game 1 the way you probably should when Nikola Vucevic is the opposing centre. Vooch is just asking to be put in the blender, and to open the third quarter on Tuesday, Leonard and Gasol smashed the puree button. Upon seeing this sequence live, it became clear Vucevic was utterly screwed at about the 0:08 mark:


Gasol and Leonard essentially spent three minutes off the top of the half doing yard work while the kids watched and took notes on how to diagonally stripe the lawn.

The next time down, Gasol sets the screen for Leonard off the ball, befuddling Vucevic and Aaron Gordon again, freeing Gasol to can a triple off Kawhi’s pass to the wing. For fun, I left in the tail end of the previous defensive possession where Dad 1 and Dad 2 choked off the D.J. Augustin-Vucevic pick-and-roll at the source.


On that note: get a load of those protective instincts, defending the Raptors against the thing that poses the most danger to the team. Extreme dad stuff right there.

Gasol and Leonard did a bang-up job neutralizing the Augustin-Vucevic threat in Game 2. Augustin had 25 points on his own in Game 1; he and his big man combined for just 15 on 4-of-15 from the field in Tuesday’s series-evener.

“A lot of that starts with Marc’s physicality and his IQ,” said Nurse of the Raptors slowing Vucevic down for a second-straight game. “The biggest thing you’ve got to do, not with Vucevic, with any really good post player is try to push the catches out … so they’re starting from a point farther away. They’re less comfortable, the percentages obviously go down the further away you can keep them.

“Just think he played him real physical, played him real smart, didn’t give him anything real easy. He did a great job on him.”

Leonard did his part to hinder the source of Orlando’s flow, too. Per NBA.com’s match-up data, the Magic managed just six points on the seven possessions for which Leonard was Augustin’s primary defender.

Both he and Gasol hawked steals all over the damn place in Game 2. Gasol’s four swipes were some shit out of a game of Octopus — rather than lunge into passing lanes, more often than not he just kinda shot is arms out at opportune times to snag would-be Orlando passes without having to move his feet. FitBit will never sponsor him. Skechers might though, because dads need arch support.

One of the most fatherly things one can do is to impart lessons upon the youths they’re ushering through life. Leonard and Gasol surely have behind-the-scenes nuggets of advice to pass along from their many years of Western Conference playoff wars, each and every one of them valuable. But there’s something to be said for a tangible, hands-on lesson — whether it’s about replacing a car part or how to suck out an opponent’s soul — that the spoken word can’t quite replicate.

Everything about Leonard’s Game 2 performance was worth trying to copy. And Pascal Siakam, who’s been good — albeit a tad squirrelly — through the series’ first two games, was just trying to take it all in.

“He was great,” said Siakam of Leonard’s 37-point, 23-shot showing. “Just seeing the type of shots that he was making and the way he was playing tonight — he was in foul trouble, too. The way he was playing with all of those fouls, and he’s still being himself and playing like he’s supposed to, it’s pretty impressive for me just to watch.”

https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/fl-sp-miami-heat-main-s20190418-story.html,"This was supposed to be the season when the Miami Heat were going to figure it out with Hassan Whiteside, mostly because that's what Heat President Pat Riley said a year ago.

To refresh in the wake of this just-completed season that saw Whiteside's playing time marginalized to an average of 17.3 minutes over the season's final 19 games, this was Riley on April 30, 2018:

""There has to be an intervention and I'm going to be the intervener. That's real. . . . The disconnect between he and Spo, that's going to take a discussion between them and its going to take thought on the part of Coach and also Hassan.""

As in getting Whiteside and coach Erik Spoelstra on the same page when it came to the center the Heat signed to a four-year, $98 million contract on July 1, 2016.

Then there was Riley two months later, on the night of the 2018 NBA draft, on June 21, dismissing the need for such a formal summit.

""Whatever happened then was two months ago,"" Riley said at the time, ""you move on and you make the best of it. I think that’s where we are right now.""

And then came Riley this past weekend at AmericanAirlines Arena, when asked about Whiteside not only being removed from the starting lineup for the final 20 games of the season but also being utilized for only 14 total minutes this season alongside emerging big man Bam Adebayo, the 2017 first-round pick out of Kentucky.

""I think we'll have a discussion about that. We already have talked about it,"" Riley said of his season-ending interaction with Spoelstra.

Riley then offered a detailed explanation of how the NBA has changed over the years, making it more complex to align big men in the same lineup, ending that comment with an offer to further broach the subject with Spoelstra, ""I can give him some help on it because I have a background in coaching.""

For his part, Whiteside took the high road over the close of the season, but stressed he wanted to play more and believed he should have played more. While he declined comment following his season-ending meeting with Spoelstra, there were numerous raw statistics that made a case in his favor. In averaging the same 23.3 minutes per game as Adebayo this season, Whiteside averaged 12.3 points to 8.9 points, 11.3 rebounds to 7.3 rebounds and 1.89 blocked shots to 0.79 blocks. Adebayo, by contrast, averaged 2.2 assists to Whiteside's 0.8, but also 1.5 turnovers to Whiteside's 1.3.

As he did at the close of the 2017-18 season, Spoelstra offered his familiar refrain that going forward, ""I'm open to anything.""

""Every offseason, we will look under the hood and evaluate, A through Z,"" he said. ""This year, the way our team was set up, we had a lot of the guys that can move the needle at our frontcourt positions. And then Bam was able to emerge from that.""

Miami Heat outlook: Ira Winderman's player-by-player breakdown
As he did a year ago, Spoelstra pushed aside the notion of a disconnect.

""I think where Hassan is right now is where he has been,"" he said. ""We value him a great deal. He anchors our defense. I know it's easy to say that he finished the season on the bench and you can look at this season as something where he took a step back. I know he would like to play more, and every player should feel that way.""

There was a moment during the final week of the season when Whiteside and Adebayo were on the court together briefly against the Minnesota Timberwolves.

""I was like, here we go!"" forward Josh Richardson said.

The two wound up playing only four seconds together that night."
https://www.nola.com/pelicans/2019/04/david-griffin-working-the-art-of-the-anthony-davis-deal-on-day-1-of-new-pelicans-era.html,"If you’re a New Orleans Pelicans fan, here’s what you should like about David Griffin.

He’s already working it.

A few days into his new job as vice president of basketball operations, Griffin is already playing chess with the rest of the NBA.

By reaching out to Klutch Sports’ Rich Paul and trying to mend fences with superstar Anthony Davis, Griffin is sending a message to the rest of the league and shrewdly positioning his new club for the critical weeks ahead. He’s letting everyone know he has a plan, and it starts with Davis.

Face it, luring Davis back to New Orleans is an extreme long shot at this point. Davis mentally checked out on New Orleans months ago. He’s become a pariah with most local fans, so there’s a lot of damage control to execute there. Truth be told, I can’t see Paul and Davis even considering it.

But it’s certainly worth a try. There’s no downside in having the conversation.

Griffin either pulls off the greatest coup in franchise history by retaining Davis. Or – at worst – he leverages the rest of the league into thinking he might and ups the ante for his services.

Griffin knows the best way to make a deal is when you have leverage. And the Pelicans had little before as far as Davis is concerned before Griffin took over. Now, rival executives will at least know he isn’t ready to just jettison Davis because its an awkward situation.

It’s such a smart move and should give Pelicans fans confidence that Griffin fully understands the art of deal-making.

The Pelicans win either way.


Griffin is sending a clear message to the rest of the league: If you want Davis, be prepared to pay a premium. The Pelicans aren’t going to give away the All-NBA big man.

Maybe that’s why Griffin declared he was “extremely optimistic” about the Davis situation just minutes into his speech at his introductory press conference on Wednesday (April 17) at Pelicans headquarters. He knows the Davis deal represents a golden opportunity to kick-start the Pelicans’ rebuilding plan. Players with Davis’ talent don’t become available in their prime very often. When they do, they should demand a king’s ransom in return.

The New Orleans Pelicans introduced David Griffin as the team’s new executive vice president of basketball operations on Wednesday (April 17).

1. The infrastructure will grow

Griffin made it clear that Pelicans owner Gayle Benson was committed to building a winner in New Orleans. He spoke about talking with Benson in the interview process and coming away impressed.

“And believe me,” Griffin said, “I made some outrageous demands in that conversation. I’m very comfortable she’s 100-percent committed.”

Benson was just as impressed with Griffin throughout the interview process.

“He was amazing,” Benson said. “He was just the perfect fit for us. We had a punch list of what we wanted and he checked all of the boxes. Some of the other candidates checked some of the boxes but he checked all of them. Everything he stands for, everything he believes in.

""He was our first candidate, and right off the bat, I said, ‘I really like this guy.’ But I knew I needed to hear everybody else. But I kept going back to him and going back to him. We’re very fortunate to get him. This is a real coup for us.”

Part of Benson’s commitment to Griffin will be the increase in size of the front office. Griffin didn’t get into specifics about what positions he is set to hire but did say ownership will support him.

“I do have people in my mind but I didn’t make demands relative to a name,” Griffin said. “There were people types, individuals involved, that absolutely that were non-starters for me not to bring. But I also don’t feel like it was a situation where ownership had to tell me yes you have to hire that person. They just needed to tell me we had the bandwidth to hire the right people.”

Griffin also said that he doesn’t have specific titles in mind for anyone else he might bring on – specifically general manager – but will give someone the title of GM if that’s what it takes to bring them into the fold.

2. Jrue Holiday isn’t going anywhere

Griffin talked at length about Anthony Davis and his desire to sit down with the Pelicans’ superstar about wanting to stay in New Orleans. But he also spoke about Jrue Holiday and how much he thinks Holiday can be a part of what gets built in New Orleans.

“I think he’s excited about the direction,” Griffin said of Holiday. “He wants to compete. I have every reason to believe he’s going to want to do that with us. Jrue was a guy who frankly is a competitor. He’s what you want your franchise to represent. He’s very meaningful.”

Holiday just completed his 10th NBA season and is one year removed from being named to the NBA’s All-Defensive first team. This year, Holiday played in 67 games before he was shut down after having surgery on his core muscle.

He averaged a career-high 21.2 points per game to go along with 5 rebounds (also a career best) and 7.7 assists a night.

As long as Holiday wants to be in New Orleans, it seems like Griffin will be happy keeping him there.

3. Griffin and Gentry will push each other

Although there was a sector of the Pelicans’ fan base that wanted the team to start completely fresh, Alvin Gentry will be staying on as the Pelicans’ head coach and part of that is because of Griffin’s relationship with him.

Griffin and Gentry worked together in Phoenix, where Griffin was working his way up the ladder when Gentry joined as an assistant coach in 2004. Griffin interviewed Gentry for the head coaching position in Cleveland in 2014.

That relationship the two have built could lead to the two keeping one another in check in New Orleans.

“We’re able to challenge each other,” Griffin said.

Gentry was all smiles at the press conference. He sat next to Meredith, Griffin’s wife, and even joked with Griffin on stage. While Benson and Saints/Pelicans president Dennis Lauscha presented Griffin with a jersey with his name on it, Griffin held it up with the front of the jersey and New Orleans on the front.

Gentry called out from the front row to get Griffin to turn it around which made Griffin say, “You can tell I’m not used to holding a jersey.”

If Gentry can’t get the job done, Griffin will still be quick to make a move. He fired David Blatt in the middle of the 2015-16 season and installed Ty Lue as the head coach… and Lue led Cleveland to a championship just months later.

4. He wants to win titles

Speaking of championships, that’s going to be a bad word to say around the Pelicans’ facility.

“Make no mistake about this, we’re in the business of competing for championships,” Griffin said. “This is also the last day anyone in basketball operations will use that word. That’s a not a word that you just use.

Wait… what?

“If other people want to use it, OK,” he continued. “But everyone here, they understand this, you don’t say the word championship. You earn the right for other people to say it about you by the actions you take every single day.”

Griffin was also pretty clear that he wants to change the culture in New Orleans and that Benson will help with her commitment to the team.

5. Don’t tell Griffin you can’t win in small markets

Griffin had some very strong feelings about being told you can’t win in small markets in the NBA.

“This came up in the interview process,” Griffin said. “The notion that’s small markets can’t win in nonsense. We won in Cleveland. We had a parade and there was 1.6 million (people) down there.”

Things were different for Griffin in Cleveland. There was pressure to win a championship right away because LeBron James was on the team. No one wanted to waste James’ time.

Things are different in New Orleans, though.

“We won in a very inorganic way (in Cleveland),” Griffin said. “This is a situation where we get to play the long game and have the mindset of sustaining success. It’s a different thing.

“For this city and this community, it’s really meaningful. It’s not easy to just flip the switch and win a championship tomorrow. But if you start building to the ethos of the city, you can build something that attracts the right people. We want to build something that’ll last. This city gives us the chance to do it.”

Griffin said he got really upset at the notion that small markets can’t win. In fact, he used some strong language to do so.

“That’s bulls---,” he said. “Tell that to all the small markets that have already done it. How big is San Antonio?”

https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/sports/pelicans/article_0971a3a4-6191-11e9-ae4f-33974686fe23.html,"It took David Griffin 30 minutes to know he was ready for his life to change.

After spurning interest from various places across the league over the past two years, Griffin was in the midst of his formal interview with the New Orleans Pelicans when he began to recognize the franchise in front of him isn’t what he expected.

For most of the organization’s history, the Pelicans (and Hornets) brandished a reputation across the NBA as a thrifty, unambitious outfit which sought ways to win without participating in many aspects of the arms race attached to today’s costly, cutthroat environment.

The team’s infrastructure was limited. Their G-League franchise doesn’t start until next season, and there’s no massive analytics department, or immense luxury tax payment being made.

Instead, the Pelicans are like many of the league’s small-market teams, eager to compete with the NBA’s best on the court but not feasibly able to match the structural advantages because of revenue disparities.

But that wasn’t the message Griffin received when sitting face-to-face with owner Gayle Benson two weeks ago.

He didn’t hear about living within his means, or setting up his operation on value. Instead, nearly everything the former Cavaliers general manager desired was met with an affirmative response by Benson, who acquired the franchise from her late husband last year.

Smash cut to Wednesday, and there’s Griffin standing next to Benson, officially being named the team’s executive vice president of basketball operations.

“Believe me I made some outrageous demands in that conversation,” Griffin confessed. “And I’m very comfortable in saying she’s 100 percent committed. She is excited to put her stamp on the franchise.”

Let’s take a second to recognize the gravity of that statement.

 David Griffin's message to Anthony Davis: 'Are you all the way in, or are you all the way out?'
David Griffin's message to Anthony Davis: 'Are you all the way in, or are you all the way out?'
While it’s entirely unknown whether Griffin can actually acquire the necessary talent to win at a high level and turn this moribund unit into a playoff fixture, this part matters. Investment counts.

Based purely on market size and economics, it’s unreasonable to expect the revenue gap between the Pelicans and Lakers to narrow, even if the Pelicans maximize their local TV deal and sell out the Smoothie King Center every night.

But what drew Griffin to New Orleans is his belief those realities won’t hinder his plan of attack, because it’s not determining what kind of commitment is being made.

“In terms of their willingness to deliver on those things,” Griffin said, “I was probably in the room for 30 minutes before I started feeling like, ‘Wow, I hope I don’t mess this up.’ ”

He didn’t.

Now the challenge begins. According to Griffin, the Pelicans have done their part.

 With Pelicans hiring David Griffin, team's next major decision involves coach Alvin Gentry's future

They’ve committed the money and resources to build a robust front office, not handcuffed by a small staff or lacking technology. But properly utilizing those resources to actually gain a meaningful edge in the intensely competitive NBA landscape is far more challenging proposition.

Griffin has some ideas on where to start. And it begins with personnel.

Before he concerns himself with titles, like potentially adding a general manager beneath him, Griffin explained his larger concern is attracting the right people to New Orleans. And he’s been given assurances from ownership he can pick a wide-ranging staff to suit his needs.

“We need to get all the right people on the bus and we can figure out what we call each other once we are rolling to the right place, and I think that’s a really meaningful thing,” Griffin said. “I think the areas you have the biggest ability to build competitive advantage in infrastructure is very much in performance and player care. It’s an area I put a lot of weight on and area I’m very familiar with re-working and believing in.”

Considering the Pelicans’ lack of roster development (due largely to trading every first-round pick since 2012) and incessant battle with calamitous injuries, few fans would contest Griffin’s priorities there.

But, his desires to gain an edge go beyond those obvious on-court angles and dig deeper into statistical trends and measurements, an area the Pelicans never fully explored during Demps’ tenure.

“I think you can (gain an advantage) with the analytics side,” Griffin said. “Not necessarily relative to saying we have the greatest ‘Nerd Cave’ in the NBA, which is what we called our group in Cleveland. It’s not about that. It’s about, do we have the best ability to translate what the data reveals in a meaningful way? Because data is not an answer in and of itself.

“It’s only as good as quality of questions you ask it to solve. That’s what analytics needs to be able to do. That requires not just the right people crunching numbers, but the right people communicating them.”

The overarching theme to Griffin’s introduction was his desire to bring a holistic, sustainable approach to a franchise that, for many reasons, never fully employed one. Wednesday’s comments crystallized the notion many of the obvious obstacles have been cleared.

While the distaste of losing and the ugliness of upheaval made for a difficult season, particularly Anthony Davis’ midseason trade request, the long-term ramifications could reap major benefits. Not only does Griffin arrive possessing the budget and backing to build out a first-rate front office, he also answers to a reshaped power structure by getting a direct line to Benson, while not being beholden to the franchise’s sins of the past.

Those are all fundamental, foundational fixes a playoff season likely wouldn’t have solved.

There are no more excuses to allow mortgaging the long term for the short term. There’s no more finger-pointing about what the franchise doesn’t have."
https://www.nbadraft.net/mcdonalds-all-american-game-west-recap-0,"Wiseman put up 13 points while shooting 4-8. He scored a few different ways; an and one layup in the post, converting offensive rebounds into dunks, and hit a midrange off the dribble with the defense in his face. He wasn’t able to get to the basket as often as he would have liked with Isaiah Stewart’s physicality but he battled in the paint. Wiseman is skilled offensively but still needs further development when it comes to finishing post moves and consistently knocking down jump shots. He showed some solid passing out of the post and had a nice lob over the defense to lead Oscar Tshiebwe to an easy two points. Wiseman was a perfect five-for-five on free throws and grabbed six rebounds in the game.

Jeremiah Robinson Earl 6’9 235 PF - Villanova

Robinson-Earl gives you something new with each basket. He can score in the post, with his first points coming on a nice pivot move on the block to go under the defender’s arm and pump faking into an and-one while finishing with his left hand. He also knocked down a three from outside. He had hustle plays as well, an easy dunk and tipping in his own miss to finish with 13 points. In addition to his offense, he did well defending multiple positions. He also pulled down four rebounds and committed five turnovers.

Tyrese Maxey 6’4 185 SG - Kentucky

Maxey wasn’t shy about getting shots off. He used his killer floater and quick release from three, which is where all his points came from. He ended with 13 points while shooting 5-10 from the floor and 3-6 from three. He didn’t grab any rebounds and unfortunately, only had one assist. On the defensive end, he came away with two steals.

Oscar Tshiebwe 6’9 250 PF/C – West Virginia

Despite Tshiebwe struggling some during practices, he brought a soft touch in the game; hitting a nice fadeaway on his first play after checking in, making a jump hook after an offensive rebound a little later, and showing smooth form on free throws. A majority of his points came on dunks and he did an excellent job of outhustling everyone. On one play, he defended Trendon Watford on a jump shot on a deep two, to crash the glass for the rebound. Tshiebwe finished with 12 points on 5-7 shooting and grabbed ten rebounds with four coming on offense.

Samuell Williamson 6’7 190 SF - Louisville

Williamson showed nice midrange shooting with a fadeaway and an elevated jumper. He made both of his free throws and dribbled into an open three to score 11 points. Williamson had a good showing over the week with his size, versatility, and ability to score from all three levels. He grabbed three rebounds and has the tools on the defensive end as well.

Matthew Hurt 6’9 215 SF/PF - Undecided

Matthew Hurt
Matthew Hurt
Hurt scored eight points and grabbed five rebounds for the West. He started the game with a layup after catching a teammate’s blocked shot. He had a nice pick and roll with Josh Green that led Hurt to an open jam. He didn’t get to show his outside shooting, missing both of his three-point attempts but he banked in a fadeaway from midrange. Hurt had a solid performance and gave good effort overall.

Nico Mannion 6’3 180 PG - Arizona

Mannion contributed with eight points while making three of his eight shots. He didn’t shoot incredibly well but hit a midrange step back and a corner three off the catch. Two of his points came from throwing an alley oop that went into the basket. Manion brings a good blend of scoring and passing, also running the point and playing off the ball. He didn’t grab any rebounds but finished with two assists.

Josh Green 6’6 205 SG - Arizona

Green didn’t make either of his three-pointers but scored eight points on some nice drives. He scored on a strong layup and hit an up and under on the baseline. He didn’t display his high-level athleticism much but closed the game with an open jam. His ballhandling and playmaking has improved since last year, as mentioned earlier, he had a bullet pass to Matthew Hurt on a pick and roll that he might not have made in previous years.

Isaiah Mobley 6’10 235 PF - USC

Mobley’s five points came on an open three pointer and staying with his own miss for an easy put back. He shot just 2-7 but showed some nice passing for his size with four assists to only one turnover, including a dime to Oscar Tshiebwe that led to a dunk. Mobley didn’t have a lot of offense ran through him but flashed his skillset.

Tre Mann 6’4 180 PG - Florida

Mann didn’t have a great scoring performance with five points on 2-7 shooting. He hit an NBA three off the dribble after previously missing the rim on another attempt, going 1-4 from behind the arc. He caught an alley oop layup for his other field goal. He was one of the few point guards on the West, but he finished with no assists to one turnover. He grabbed three rebounds and had two steals. Mann had a good showing in the two days of practice but wasn’t able to match in the game.

Kahlil Whitney 6’7 200 SF - Kentucky

Whitney’s only two points came from a dunk in the open floor. He shot 1-5 and didn’t show much half-court offense. He didn’t have any assists and his two turnovers came from passing right to the defense which led to transition dunks. A few of his passes were deflected in practice as well and reading the defense will be an adjustment moving forward. He is a high-level athlete, as he demonstrated on one play with a nice hustle block even though a foul was called.

Bryan Antoine 6’5 180 SG - Villanova

Antoine scored two points on a pretty baseline floater but would miss his other three shots in the game. He had three assists to three turnovers. He has a habit of picking up his dribble early and didn’t seem decisive when he had the ball. Similar to the two days of practice, he blended in when he was on the court.

The Denver Nuggets dug themselves a serious hole by dropping Game 1 to the San Antonio Spurs. They went a few shovelfuls deeper by going down by as many as 19 points in Game 2. Jamal Murray couldn’t hit the side of a barn, the Spurs were executing brilliantly and Paul Millsap and Gary Harris were the only things keeping Denver in the game.

Then the shots started falling for Murray and Denver won the fourth quarter 39-23 to take the game and save their season. It was not quite the Clippers clawing back against the Warriors but this was a huge comeback and one with enormous implications for the rest of the Western Conference. The Nuggets were on the brink of upset, now a run to the top is still very much in the cards.

Takeaways
Jokic took some shots, are you happy now? Jokic had a triple-double in Game 1 but taking just nine shots was problematic when the rest of their shooters were cold and the Nuggets needed points. In Game 2, he took 15 shots and went to the free throw line six times, finishing with 21 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists. He wasn’t the finisher, that was Murray. He wasn’t the spark, that was Millsap and Harris. As he’s been all season, Jokic was simply the rock-solid foundation everything else is built on.

What happened to Denver’s depth? The Nuggets bench was one of the biggest advantages during the regular season but it hasn’t moved the needle much through their first two games. Monte Morris has played well but Mason Plumlee found foul trouble, Torrey Craig struggled and neither Juan Hernangomez or Trey Lyles played. Rotations tighten in the playoffs and it’s possible that this advantage just won’t be there for Denver in the same way but they are at their best when they’re running up the score with starters off the floor.

NEXT: Defense and Kawhi give the Raptors a huge Game 2 win over the Magic
Jamal Murray is a human roller coaster. For three quarters, he was a hot mess, missing all eight of his shots and looking generally disconnected from what the Nuggets were working towards on offense. In the fourth quarter, he dropped 21 points, making all eight of his shots from the field. It wasn’t just that the ball went in the hoop (although that helped). It was making the right decision, reading the defense, chewing ups space and also knowing when to pass up a tough floater for a dump-off to a rolling Nikola Jokic. Murray scoring efficiently and making tough shots is the variable that defines the Nuggets ceiling. Tonight, it was sky high.

Up until the fourth quarter of Game 2 of the Denver Nuggets' first-round series with the San Antonio Spurs, Jamal Murray had been -- to put it kindly -- not good. 

Not only did he shoot 8-of-23 from the field in Game 1, but he also missed a wide-open mid-range jumper with 9.4 seconds left that would have given the Nuggets the lead, then turned the ball over with two seconds left as he tried to race up the floor for a potential game-tying shot. Denver's Game 1 loss wasn't all Murray's fault, but he certainly didn't step up when they needed him. 

It wasn't going much better in Game 2. In fact, it was going worse, as Murray missed all eight of his shot attempts in the first three quarters. With Murray struggling, and the Spurs doing pretty much whatever they wanted on the offensive end, the Nuggets trailed by as many as 19 points in the middle of the third quarter. At that point, it truly looked like the Spurs would take Game 2 and be up 2-0 heading back home to San Antonio, where they were 32-9 this season. 

Murray, though, had other ideas. The young guard has always been a bit of a streaky shooter, and for as bad as he was early in this series, he was that good in the fourth quarter. In truth, though, his turnaround may have started at the end of the third quarter, when he got to the free throw line and finally saw the ball go through the net. 

In any case, he had all the confidence in the world in the fourth quarter, raining in jumper after jumper despite some pretty solid defense from the Spurs. This wasn't a case of the Spurs falling apart and losing track of Murray a bunch of times; this was elite shot-making from Murray. Just look at some of the shots he was knocking down. Fadeaways, off-balance 3s -- it didn't matter what the Spurs did.

Fortunately for Jamal Murray and the Denver Nuggets, no matter how seemingly hopeless NBA playoff games are after three quarters, they always include a fourth.  

Murray's first seven playoff quarters featured frigid shooting, but he heated up when Denver needed him most. His 21-point fourth-quarter eruption Tuesday produced a shocking 114-105 win over the San Antonio Spurs in Game 2, salvaged a series split and may have saved Denver's postseason.

There's still a long way to go in this first-round series with the Spurs, who held double-digit leads in Games 1 and 2. It'd be a mistake to say the Nuggets are in the clear. But Murray's eruption, which featured eight consecutive made buckets after an 0-of-8 start from the field, felt like something bigger than a one-off late-game takeover.

For starters, it was a study in the power of confidence. Because you have to be self-assured to take shots like this while you're staring down an 0-2 hole against a No. 7 seed:

Murray hit exceptionally difficult shots during his incendiary run—shots that players get benched for attempting. In the wake of his no-show up until the fourth quarter, a lot of coaches never would have given him the chance to take those shots.

If Nuggets head coach Mike Malone had turned away from Murray after his 8-of-23 (0-of-6 from deep) performance in Game 1, it would have been understandable. And if Malone had relied instead on Gary Harris, who scored 23 points on 10-of-16 shooting in Game 2, or Malik Beasley, who heated up in spurts during both contests of this series, nobody would have questioned it.

But Malone seemed to understand there was more at stake:

 Beautiful sentiment from Nuggets coach Michael Malone on why he stuck with Jamal Murray despite rough first three quarters in Game 2 win over Spurs: ""I knew in my heart he needed to get these minutes. I needed to show him I believed him.""

That wide-lens approach is rarely employed in the win-now environment of postseason basketball. But much of the immediate reaction to Murray's explosion seemed to apply a similar focus on the big picture.

It's easy to get hyperbolic when you've just watched someone set the nets ablaze for an entire quarter, but the consistent placement of Murray's efforts into a broader context felt right.

 This was one of the greatest performances in Nuggets playoff history. That’s not prisoner of the moment. That’s fact. Murray carried the Nuggets when the game — and the series — looked to be in peril.

That's because the Nuggets aren't an ordinary No. 2 seed. Skepticism was attached to this young team even before it fell to the Spurs in Game 1 over the weekend. That loss validated critics' concerns about Denver's lack of experience and its uncharacteristically deferential superstar, Nikola Jokic.

In seizing Game 2 like a conventional star would—by scoring and scoring and scoring—Murray quieted some of those doubts and offered a glimpse of Denver's ceiling.

Jokic isn't wired for a takeover like that. He's a passer first, and a gifted scorer (at a plodding pace) when he has to be. Since Jokic's emergence, Denver has badly needed a reliable high-volume gunner.

Murray's first seven playoff quarters negate the ""reliable"" part. Streaky might be the first word you'd use to describe him. But he's barely 22, and when a player is as obviously skilled and unafraid of the moment as he is, trusting natural development to produce more highs and fewer lows feels like a safe bet.

And if Murray uses this performance as a springboard, his pairing with Jokic could turn the Nuggets into something special.

You could see some of that Tuesday, as Jokic did everything within his considerable facilitating powers to spring his scorching teammate. Jokic assisted only one of Murray's eight fourth-quarter buckets, but he set screens, hunted handoffs and got out of the way.

It's strange to imagine Jokic, an All-NBA talent who rang up 21 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists in Game 2, as a sidekick. He's far better than that. But Jokic's game revolves around subtlety and skill. He exploits weaknesses with his passing and patience. He picks apart a defense's frailties with precision and guile. He operates with a scalpel, but it sometimes feels like he gets queasy at the sight of blood.

Murray is the Nuggets' much-needed butcher, delighting in the carnage of cutting a defense apart with bold, aggressive hacks.

Murray needed a breakthrough moment to get his postseason going, and Denver needed it ahead of a trip to San Antonio for two games that could have ended its season if Game 2 hadn't played out like it did.

Back to that big picture again, though: Murray's role in the win illustrated what this team could become.

With young squads like Denver, you focus on the ceiling. You ask what's possible if everything breaks right over a three- or four-year timeline.

If this version of Murray shows up a bit more often, the Nuggets' long-term upside is difficult to comprehend. He fills a specific shot-making, devil-may-care, ultraconfident void in the team's makeup when he goes off like this. He allows Jokic to be himself, and he permits other role players to organize themselves around a one-two punch.

He just makes everything clearer.

Yes, consistency will matter. Murray wouldn't have needed to catch fire to save Denver if he was lukewarm rather than ice cold earlier in the game. But let's not minimize the moment.

Murray's arrival could double as Denver's takeoff on a yearslong journey of success.

TORONTO – Scratch, claw, scrap, fight, win.

It’s a formula that travels well and rarely fails, provided it’s accompanied with enough talent to take a team over the top. But no matter how much talent a team has, little of significance has been won without the baring of teeth.

After a respectable effort in Game 1 earned them nothing but another series opening loss, the Toronto Raptors went tried and true in Game 2.

They didn’t so much set out to win a game over the Orlando Magic, they tried to tear them apart. Picture something in nature making another living being their lunch — the pack descending, blood in the air.

It was very Discovery Channel, and fun to watch, if you’re into that kind of thing, or a Raptors fan.

The Raptor nicknamed the Klaw was – appropriately enough – the most fearsome of all. He was less Raptor in the NBA sense than raptor in the literal sense – too fast, too big, too much.

“Leonard was, I mean, great,” said Magic head coach Steve Clifford after watching Leonard drop 37 points on 15-of-22 shooting with four assists and two steals. “What are you gonna do? He was great.”

The Raptors pretty much decided Game 2 in the first half of the third quarter as Toronto pulled away from the young Magic, who are game and not without talent but lack the kind of fire power to routinely overcome holes as big as the Raptors were digging for them.

A Kawhi Leonard steal and brute-force fastbreak, a wide-open Marc Gasol three as the Raptors whipped the ball faster than Orlando could recover and the Raptors were up by 24.

All hands were on deck. All cylinders were firing. This was the Raptors performing optimally in way they’ve shown at times since this version of the roster was bolted together at the trade deadline, but not for stretches this long or with this much at stake.

But make no mistake, the Raptors’ 111-82 win that evened their first-round series 1-1 as it shifts to Orlando for Game 3 on Friday was forged in the first five minutes of the game as Toronto went straight for the Magic’s neck.

It was as ferocious and complete a defensive effort as you’re likely to see on an NBA court. It will likely be held over the Raptors’ collective heads for the rest of the post season. As former Toronto head coach Dwane Casey used to say, “they told on themselves."
https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/10-things-from-raptors-magic-game-2-035620098.html,"Two - Redemption: This is why it was so ridiculous to defend Lowry for his dud in Game 1, because he clearly wasn’t engaged. This is what it looks like when Lowry is actually involved - he’s unmistakable and ubiquitous. Lowry bounced back in a major way, and it wasn’t just with his 22 points. He was fearless in going to the rim, dove on the floor for loose balls, sacrificed his body for charges, guarded just about every wing on the Magic, blocked D.J. Augustin at the rim, and broke down the defense to create open looks for his teammates.

Three - Promising: Not only were the threes falling, but Lowry attacked the rim with a ferocity that has been absent for most of the season. There was one possession in the third where Lowry went end-to-end for a layup in about five seconds, and he needs to stay in attack mode. The Raptors should be considered favorites to come out of the East if Lowry plays like this consistently throughout the playoffs.

Four - Encouragement: Even by Toronto standards, this was an outstanding crowd, and they were determined to cheer on their point guard. Scotiabank Arena exploded with the excitement (decibel levels rivalled that of free pizza) when Lowry hit a free-throw in the first, and the night ended with Lowry getting a standing ovation as he checked out in the fourth.

Five - Superstar: You won’t catch anyone complaining about load management after Kawhi Leonard exploded for 37 points on 15-of-22 shooting. It’s only Game 2 of the playoffs, but Leonard has already put together one of the best Raptors postseason performances of all-time. It still falls short of Lowry scoring 35 in Game 7 to qualify for the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals, and it’s not Vince Carter’s 50 points against the Sixers, but is there any doubt that Leonard can top those performances if need be? Leonard delivered a reminder tonight - he’s a top-three player and this is why Masai Ujiri and Bobby Webster risked everything to get him.

Six - Omnipotent: Leonard was in such a groove that he started toying with the defense, which is highly out of character for an otherwise straightforward player. He busted out every crossover in his bag, pulled up for threes over 7-footers, split traps before driving through the lane for dunks, picked the ball at will, and even tried acrobatic reverse layups. He did everything short of sip a beer and spin the ball in Serge Ibaka’s face. It was a “LeBronto” performance, only in reverse.

Seven - Unstoppable: It’s abundantly clear that the Magic have no answer for Leonard and Marc Gasol working pick-and-roll in the middle of the floor. Gasol’s screens are too robust for Gordon to evade, and Nikola Vucevic is too slow to affect Leonard in any way. The Magic can either double Leonard, which leaves Gasol open for three, or switch on the play and risk Leonard attacking Vucevic in isolation. The Raptors should spam this combination ad nauseam for the remainder of the series.

Eight - Shutdown: Gasol has single-handedly turned Vucevic into a liability. Vucevic followed up a miserable 3-of-14 shooting performance in Game 1 with just six points on seven shots tonight. Not only has Gasol entirely swallowed up Vucevic in the post, but Gasol was also able to show higher and cut off Augustin while also denying the pocket pass to Vucevic.

Nine - Adjustment: After tinkering with dual-center lineups and other misconceived lineups in Game 1, Nurse just went to the simple solution of having Leonard and Siakam cover all the important minutes at power forward in the absence of OG Anunoby. That’s how it should be for the remainder of the series - play the best lineups so you can rest instead of resting until your best lineups are needed.

Ten - Concern: However, the absence of Anunoby was still felt in Terrence Ross’s 15 points off the bench. Fred VanVleet stuck to Ross like glue, but Ross is nearly eight inches taller and was easily able to rise over VanVleet for a clean look at three. Nurse could switch Norman Powell onto Ross, but VanVleet would still be covering a bigger player in Evan Fournier."

You get the feeling the third quarter was exactly how Masai Ujiri envisioned things back in July, and again once more in February.

No, the storyboard surely didn’t call for a Game 1 loss to the Orlando Magic. That was perhaps unavoidable, with the Raptors ignominious history in series openers dictating as it does. It probably didn’t include the Raptors with their backs seemingly against the wall so early, a tough and effortful upstart on the verge of too much confidence. It definitely didn’t lay out yet another non-crisis of confidence for their star point guard.

The Raptors at their best, though? The Raptors with stakes to play for? The Playoff Raptors, the absolute measure of all of the team’s tinkering since a second consecutive premature ouster?

Those Raptors would look exactly like this.

It wasn’t just in the third quarter that the fully actualized version of the Raptors reared their heads in Tuesday’s 111-82..."

PMG PHOTO: CHRISTOPHER OERTELL - Damian Lillard goes to the basket for the Trail Blazers as they down the Oklahoma City Thunder 114-94 at Moda Center on Tuesday. Portland takes a 2-0 lead to OKC in the teams' NBA best-of-seven first-round playoff series.

The Trail Blazers have tightened the noose around the necks of the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Now we'll see if the Blazers let them up for air.

Portland gave the Thunder little breathing room Tuesday night at Moda Center, breaking open a tight game with a torrid third quarter that paved the way to a 114-94 rout of Paul George, Russell Westbrook and company.

The Blazers grabbed a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven first-round playoff series that continues with the next two games at Chesapeake Arena. Damian Lillard said he is taking nothing for granted.

""I know how quickly things can change,"" Portland's All-Star point guard said. ""A series doesn't start until you win a game on the road. I also know how capable their team is.

""We have to maintain our focus, stay sharp and understand how well we played in the first two games is not going to be good enough in the third game, especially on their home floor. We've got to keep our heads down and keep working.""

Lillard and CJ McCollum carried the offensive load, and their teammates ""did the dirty work,"" as McCollum put it, en route to a beat-down that seemed to leave the Thunder dejected and, perhaps, mentally defeated.

McCollum scored 33 points and Lillard 29, more than enough to quell the Thunder in a game in which their shots weren't falling — again.

One game can turn things around in a series, as Lillard suggests. But if the Thunder keep shooting from downtown as they have in the first two games, they can make reservations for cocktails at some tropical paradise beginning Monday.

Oklahoma City was 5 for 28 from 3-point range after going 5 for 33 in Game 1. That's a combined 10 for 61 (.164) for a team that shot .391 from beyond the arc in sweeping four games from the Blazers during the regular season.

George scored 27 points on 11-for-20 shooting, but was 2 for 7 from the 3-point line, making him 6 for 22 in the series.

Westbrook had a near triple-double with 14 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds, but he also had six turnovers and was 5 for 20 from the field, including 1 for 6 on 3-point attempts.

Westbrook is 1 for 10 on 3's in the series. Jerami Grant and Dennis Schroder are both 0 for 8, Terrance Ferguson 2 for 7. Soldiers from the ""F Troop"" never shot so poorly.

""Clearly, for the last two games, we have not shot the ball well,"" OKC coach Billy Donovan said. ""It was encouraging in Game 1 we had a chance to win (in a 104-99 loss) while not shooting well. Certainly, the 3-point line was a major part of the story tonight.""

The Blazers shot well — .467 from the field and .406 (13 for 32) from 3-point range — and defended maybe a little better. Moe Harkless and Al-Farouq Aminu made George work for everything he got, and Lillard buffaloed Westbrook, recording two blocked shots and three steals in his 37 minutes.

""He's really competitive,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said of Lillard. ""As a group, we're all trying to play defense, but 'Dame' is really focused at both ends of the floor. He knows how important it is.

""Dame's defense has improved over time. He's a much better defensive player than people give him credit for. No question he was locked in tonight.""

The Thunder came out better than they did on Sunday, when they surrendered 39 first-quarter points to the Blazers. OKC led throughout most of the early going and was in front 46-36 with five minutes left in the second quarter.

But the Blazers fought their way back and got to even at 54-54 on a 27-foot 3-pointer by McCollum as time expired at the break.

Portland then outscored OKC 37-21 in the third quarter, Lillard duplicating McCollum with a step-back 3 as the clock hit zero to take a 91-75 lead into the final period. The Thunder got no closer than 14 points the rest of the way.

McCollum — in his fourth game since sitting out 10 with a sprained right knee — sank 12 of 22 shots from the field, 3 of 7 from 3-point range and 6 of 6 at the free throw line.

Lillard was 10 for 21 from the field, 4 for 8 from the 3-point line and 5 of 7 from the foul line.

""When you have two guys who can create their shots, create problems for the defense, it makes their teammates better,"" Stotts said. ""Scoring is important in this game. When you have two guys like that, it's hard to replicate.""

Lillard felt Portland's work at the defensive end, though, was equally important.

(OKC is) going to go as far as (Westbrook) and Paul George take them,"" he said. ""If we don't defend him and they come out there believing and they're coming after us, we don't have much of a chance.

""We're going to take that challenge. Our season is on the line.""

Lillard and McCollum got ample help. Harkless contributed 14 points on 6-for-9 shooting with nine rebounds. Seth Curry came off the bench to score nine points and knock down 3 of 4 3-point attempts. Zach Collins provided six points, four rebounds and three blocks in a reserve role and — with Enes Kanter in foul trouble and playing only 20 minutes — Meyers Leonard provided muscle at the defensive end along with five points and four rebounds, drawing a loud ovation when he departed near game's end.

George was asked what the Thunder need to do to change things after putting up their worst two 3-point shooting games of the season.

""Keep shooting,"" he said. ""We're going to make shots. Keep shooting. We missed shots, so what? Keep shooting."""
https://8points9seconds.com/2019/04/16/indiana-pacers-8-points-quarter/,"Reggie Miller scored 8 points in under 9 seconds. The Indiana Pacers scored 8 points in a full 12 minute quarter on Sunday. Why?
The Indiana Pacers scored 108 points per game this season. Some quick math tells me that is 27 points per quarter, a healthy amount. The Pacers won multiple games this season in which they only scored a teen-something amount of points in an individual quarter.

Bad quarters are survivable.

Atrocious quarters are not.

Combine the 1st, 2nd, and 4th quarters of the Pacers Game 1 loss to Boston, and the Pacers have a 66-58 lead on the scoreboard. Throw in the 3rd quarter, and Indiana lost by double digits. That’s how bad the 3rd quarter was, fueled (or, in this case, not fueled) by a harrowing 8 point quarter in which the Pacers only made 2 shots.

This cannot happen in the postseason. It shouldn’t happen ever, but especially not on the biggest stage. No team should come out and make 2 shots in an entire quarter. Period. Why am I still elaborating on this? I myself have hit two shots in a basketball quarter and I stopped playing at age 16. I would score 0 against the Celtics, but you get the idea.

There was a rush to assign blame. This has to be someone’s fault. There is a reason this putrid stretch happened, and we have to know what it is so that it can never happen again. Let’s go to the film, shall we?

Perhaps we should have seen a dud of a quarter coming. The first two possessions were turnovers, only bailed out of conceding points by a Myles Turner chase-down block and  Jayson Tatum miss. It took the Pacers over 100 seconds to even release a shot.

Finally, they get one up, on this possession:



That’s not the worst look ever considering it was at the end of the shot clock — a testament to the Celtics defense. Thankfully, Myles Turner tipped it out and kept the ball in the Pacers hands for another 14. They used the shot clock reset to get this look:



Baynes dropped and let DC have that shot. It’s not a bad shot, it was wide open and DC has hit those all season. There’s a reason Baynes let him half it though, the math says that’s a bad shot. It’s open so I’m mostly okay with it. Either way, the Indiana Pacers had a 40-second possession turn into 2 misses. No matter. Teams miss two shots in a row all the time. No need to panic.

The Indiana Pacers would go on to get steals the next two possessions. The first one set up this three-point jumper:



Why Darren Collison picked up his dribble in a 3-on-2 situation I will never know, but he is usually a sound decision maker so I will give him the benefit of the doubt. The result was a wide open 3 for a great shooter in Turner, so no complaints. It just didn’t fall. That’s two good looks that haven’t fallen so far. Keep tally. Or don’t because I’m about to for you.

Here is the ensuing shot after the second steal, this time from DC:



That’s a great look in transition that just rimmed out (get used to those words). That’s 3 good looks in a row that just haven’t gone down, which is just as frustrating for you and I the viewer as it is for the team. Regardless, the team still led by 5, so no need to mope.

After Horford hit a shot inside on the other end, the Pacers came back down looking to avenge their 3 open misses in a row. They run some nice floppy action to get Wes Matthews a great look, but I’m sure you know the trend by now:



The announcer nailed it. The Pacers “seem a little bit deflated”. After fighting like hell to have a lead at halftime, to watch four straight good looks not fall is incredibly frustrating. The next one must fall. It’s the gambler’s fallacy.

Then a game-altering play occurred as Thad Young committed his fourth foul, which forced Nate McMillan to pull him for Domantas Sabonis about 5 minutes earlier than he normally does. That doesn’t really throw off any sets or anything, but the rhythm of the team alters ever so slightly. That matters, and it was evident.

With Sabonis in, though, the Pacers do the logical thing and have him immediately spearhead one of his textbook PnRs. Darren Collison gets a GREAT look from 15 feet.

It rimmed out:



Of course, it did. That’s 5 straight great looks. However, this possession could have ended with a better shot. Why is Myles Turner standing right under the basket, essentially nullifying any chance that the roll man can be open? The timing of Turner rotating to the corner was off, and the possession suffered. There is a display of your off-beat rhythm AND your misfortunate on rim-outs.

Still, a tie game! There are plenty of chances to make this right. Perhaps a creative offensive set can create the shot the Pacers need to get on the board.

And creative the next set was. Sabonis faked a PnR with Wesley Matthews, and Matthews quickly fired the ball to Turner at the elbow. Domas shifts over to run a 4-5 PnR with Turner, and Myles gets a great look at an open jumper from the top of the key.

It, you guessed correctly, rimmed out:



The optimism was draining from the Pacers at this point. 6 straight good looks not falling overlapping with your lead disappearing dominates your mental psyche. It’s just as hard to overcome as a matchup disadvantage or talent discrepancy.

On the other end, Indiana forced a Kyrie Irving miss… only to watch Baynes put in a putback. The most deflating defensive play. You get a stop — the literal only objective of defense, and still concede points. Almost all the air was out of the tires for the Pacers.

Finally, though, the Pacers get some points as Myles Turner attacked the basket and drew a foul. He only hit one of the two free throws (another theme to keep an eye on), but it was a point. Salvation at last. And it came from an obvious source — attacking the basket. The good looks they had created so far were all jumpers — good shots, but not as good as getting to the rim. Myles said “screw it” and attacked. He was rewarded with points. That should have resonated with Indy more than it did.

Next possession, after forcing a miss, the Indiana Pacers miraculously still had a chance to tie the game. Collison tried to drive to the basket but was thwarted by 2 Celtic defenders. That was Boston’s goal – stop the drives.

On a similar action to the Turner jumper from two possessions before, Sabonis set a pindown screen at the elbow for DC while he was resetting after his drive. The Pacers point guard whipped around and launched an open jumper over the dropping big, but he left it short, another clunked open look:"

He said that he’s needed now, and it’s true, but he will likely need a new nickname.

We’ve seen glimpses of Scary Terry in 14 starts this year. He posted a +11 net rating along with 5.0 more points, 1.6 more rebounds and 2.5 more assists per game than in his bench role. Those starts all came in the absence of Kyrie Irving. With Marcus Smart out, conventional wisdom suggests that Rozier would slide into those minutes, but Irving’s here to play nearly the entirety of every playoff game and there may not be as big an opportunity for Terry to be as scary as he was in last year’s post season.

Rozier received 37 touches in the win over the Pacers. Irving led the team with 76. In cases where Irving sits out, Rozier averaged 71 in 14 games. The ball runs through Rozier on those nights. Now filling minutes vacated by Marcus Smart’s oblique injury, his role looks more like Smart’s than Rozier’s sans Kyrie.


“With Marcus, you can really play Kyrie off the ball and he can be a cutter and those types of things,” Stevens said. “We’ll play Terry and Gordon more with Kyrie than we have, but I think ultimately we’ll have one point guard on the floor.”

Boston ran eight pick-and-roll sets through Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum and Rozier. That matched what the Celtics did throughout the regular season. Irving ran point guard alone for 11 minutes with the starters, who posted a +14 net rating.

Irving’s 17 minutes with Hayward yielded a +41 net rating. His eight with Rozier resulted in a -13 mark, including a 93 offensive rating.

Rozier’s activity in Game 1 boiled down to three possessions in transition, where he scored four points. He missed a shot in isolation, and two more in spot-up situations. In line with his regular season, he shot 1-for-6 and split his free throws in 18 minutes.

Rozier finished 37% from the field and 33% from the field this season as a reserve. His defense lapsed in spots. He would hunt shots and jack them up for the sake of shooting as he did in a blowout loss to the Chicago Bulls after the All-Star break. A year of turmoil for the Celtics began with speculation about Rozier’s tweets, and since then he has embodied the streakiness of the roster.


Danny Ainge stuck with his prized pick from the 2015 NBA Draft and Brad Stevens — intent on his philosophy of keeping the whole roster involved — funneled minutes to Rozier. That playing time remains, though Hayward has played as an effective secondary point guard to create off-ball opportunities for Irving. Rozier filled a miscellaneous offensive role, shooting wherever he can with little consistency.

Irving and Rozier, in 441 minutes this year, still posted a +4.2 net rating together, compared to +5.6 for Irving and Smart. They did not light fireworks offensively, but opponents scored under 97 points per 100 possessions against that two-man lineups — second best among Celtics duos that played at least 300 minutes together.

Darren Collison, Tyreke Evans, Cory Joseph and Wesley Matthews combined to shoot 4-for-24 with Rozier as their primary defender. With a 78 defensive rating, he squeaked out a positive net rating. That defense — which wavered in the regular season — could become his key contribution in this series.

Irving misses Smart, which we knew, as he played in all but two of the team’s five-man lineups that were a positive net rating in over 60 minutes together. Rozier’s job is not to become Smart, but to minimize the loss.

“[I’m going to] go out there and play my game,” Rozier said. “I’m not going out there [trying to] imitate nobody else. Like I said, it’s tough trying to make up for a guy like Smart.”

That much is clear in Rozier’s first appearance after the injury. It’s unclear, while still receiving playing time, how he’ll be able to revive his tumultuous contract year in Boston with this clean slate."
https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/celtics/2019/04/16/after-difficult-year-transition-gordon-hayward-comfortable-again/T4ocCoFgTs6pOV6uqEjoeN/story.html,"It wasn’t that Gordon Hayward flourished in his Celtics playoff debut. Nobody did offensively in Game 1 against the Indiana Pacers. It was that Hayward was back, and his presence was hardly a story line.

He has been inundated with questions about the fractured left tibia and dislocated ankle he suffered in his first regular-season game as a Celtic, Oct. 17, 2017. A year and a half later, against his hometown team, Hayward made his playoff debut for Boston and scored 10 points in the Celtics’ 84-74 win.

He is no longer a sympathetic figure. He is just a ballplayer trying to make an impact for a playoff team, trying to prove he’s capable of regaining his former prowess after what has been a difficult transitional year after regaining health.

His season was bumpy, with some vintage games mixed with some subpar ones. Hayward spent the season trying to find himself.

“It’s definitely been a year that’s required a lot of patience and some frustration,” he said. “Starting with just being on a minutes restriction. I never had to do that before, and then slowly working my way back and I’d have a good game and you guys would talk about me being back.

“I kind of just said it throughout the year, you can’t get too high on the highs and too low on the lows.

“You’re just trying to improve and get better through the year and I felt like I’ve done that.”

Month by month, Hayward’s numbers were essentially the same. But he averaged 18.3 points in four April games. And after the All-Star break, Hayward shot 55.1 percent from the field, a sign that his midrange jumper was becoming more effective. He is making the jump back to being a dependable option.

Hayward said he intentionally has not watched video of himself from October or November, when he was still trying to prove to himself that he could play without getting hurt. The mental hurdle proved much more challenging than the physical one.

“You could tell that I was still working my way through things, for sure,” he said. “Our team was working our way through things as well. I think we’ve improved a lot since then.”

Celtics coach Brad Stevens made Hayward a starter to begin the season, a role he didn’t appear physically ready for. His move to the bench proved to be the perfect way to get him comfortable. He could get his swagger back against other NBA reserves and methodically regain his confidence.

“I think Gordon’s been playing pretty good for a while,” said Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge. “There’s just not the injury but coming off the bench, sometimes playing 20-25 minutes.

“Gordon is playing better but it does look like he’s playing with a little bit more swagger.”

“Certainly I’m more comfortable in what I’m doing out on the court,” Hayward said. “I think our team is more comfortable as well. Some of it is getting a chance to know how I play and my strengths and learn each other’s strengths and soar with each other’s strengths.

“It’s definitely been a process for all of us.”

Hayward and his wife, Robyn, have three daughters, all under 8, including an infant born during the season. His older daughters are starting to comprehend that dad plays in the NBA and missed last season because of a “boo-boo.”

“They always ask me if I had so much fun when I play basketball because I always ask them if they had fun at school,” he said. “They just reciprocate that, and I don’t know if they know exactly what’s going on, but this year is different than last year in that they know my outfit when I’m playing basketball and they can tell the Celtics. They know the Celtics are green. They can recognize it a little more, which makes it fun.”

What’s Hayward’s answer now when they ask if he’s having fun?

“I said, ‘Yeah, I have so much fun,’ and then the next question is, ‘Were you so careful?’ Because I’ve had some ‘boo-boos,’ as they call them, and they want to make sure I’m careful when I’m playing and I don’t trip and fall.

“They don’t really understand but they have a grasp of it.”"

The Pacers talked repeatedly about the Celtics’ physicality, especially in that pivotal third quarter in Boston’s 84-74 win in the opener of the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

Indiana scored 8 points in that period on 2-for-19 shooting and one of those shots was a goaltending call, so they hit one basket (a Doug McDermott layup with 1:27 left) in the entire period.

In the other three periods, Indiana outscored the Celtics by 8 points, so they see the opportunity to win Game 2 as very possible if they can respond to the Celtics’ physical defense and hit shots.

Coach Nate McMillan appeared annoyed with Boston’s defense and the lack of foul calls, so he promised his team will increase their physicality.

“We’ve got to play through the contact,” he said after the team’s Monday afternoon practice. “They are being physical with us defensively. They’ve got two hands on our guys and being physical, and we’ve got to play through that. If the officials are going to allow that to happen, we’ve got to run through that contact. We’ve got to play that way, too. They got physical in that third quarter, bodying up. It’s playoff basketball, and we didn’t respond to that. I thought we gave in to that, especially in that third quarter.

“We didn’t handle their pressure well and we didn’t execute in that third quarter and that led to 8 points. We’ve got to be be better than that, and we can be better than that.”

Indiana shot 33.3 percent and had just two players in double figures. Small forward Bojan Bogdanovic, the team’s leading scorer after Victor Oladipo injured his knee in January, was held to 12 points on 4-for-11 shooting as the Celtics refused to let him get open for jumpers.

He noticed the extra attention.

“They did a pretty good job. It’s playoff basketball. They’re grabbing, holding,” he said. “I’ve got to do a better job getting open and send their guys to our bigs to get a hit on them and to have a wide-open shot. Overall, I think if we played defense like we did [Sunday] we’re going to be fine. We’re going to get a chance every single game.

“We started to rush in the third quarter. We’ve got to be calm and connected, especially on those moments where we cannot score the ball. I’ve got to take more responsibility in those moments and try to make some plays for my teammates or create for myself. I’ve got to stay aggressive.”

The Celtics weren’t stellar either on offense. They shot 36.4 percent and converted just 28 field goals, their lowest total since April 4, 2018, against Toronto. It was a bona fide slugfest, and the Pacers came away pleased with their defensive performance.

“It’s unfortunate that [the cold shooting] happened during the playoffs,” guard Wesley Matthews said. “We did good throughout the game, even in the third quarter when we couldn’t make a bucket. We were still able to stack a lot of defensive stops. The thing that’s killed us against this team is transition. Even when we weren’t scoring, we didn’t let that stop what our main focus was, which was getting back on defense and continue to fight, that’s what this team has been doing all season.

“[Sunday] hurt and it was the first [playoff] game [of the day] so we had all day to think about it and we don’t play until Wednesday, so we got a couple of more days to think about.”

The Pacers said they welcome the physicality. They were the No. 1 defensive team in points allowed in the NBA, and they gave up just 84 points to a club that has prolific scorers. So the goal now is to be ready for the aggressive defense, try to hit more shots, and rely on their defense to eke out Game 2.

“It’s a playoff game, the whistle is not going to be as loose as the regular season,” Matthews said. “We’ve got to get to our spots. We can’t let them fight us off our spots. We missed a lot of shots in that third quarter, we missed nine free throws, we missed 21 threes. You can’t think that’s going to happen again.

“It was physical, but that’s how you want it to be, though. You don’t want the whistle to be blowing all over the place. You want the team that’s supposed to win the game to win the game. We’re not hanging our heads by any means right now.”"
https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2019/04/boston-celtics-vs-indiana-pacers-how-the-new-starting-lineup-fared-shooting-numbers-13-things-to-watch-in-game-2.html,"The Boston Celtics and Indiana Pacers take the court for Game 2 of their first-round series on Wednesday, two days after a Game 1 victory that had all the aesthetic beauty of scraping a car’s front fender on a dip in the driveway.

Here are 13 things to watch going into Game 2, which tips off at 7:00 p.m. on TNT.

1. The shooting numbers from Sunday’s game were comically bad for the Celtics, even in a win (stats via Cleaning the Glass). Boston finished with an effective field-goal percentage of 43.2. The biggest problem area? At the rim, where the Celtics shot 52.6 percent, which would be 14th percentile for the season. Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward combined to go 10-for-28. Those numbers probably won’t hold.

2. The Pacers’ shooting numbers, impossibly, are somehow even worse: 36 percent, which is in the 0 percentile (zero? zeroith? I’m not even sure how to write shooting that bad).

3. Neither team could score in the half court. The Pacers put up 54.8 points per 100 possession in half-court sets. The Celtics were little better (66.7 points per 100 possessions), but both were 0 (zeroith?) and 1 (first?) percentile respectively (again: Not sure how to write about shooting that bad).

4. The difference? The Celtics got out in transition, especially in the third quarter. 18.9 percent of their offense on the break, and Boston added just under 10 points via fast-break offense. The final margin? 10 points.

5. Nate McMillan talked about limiting the Celtics in transition before Sunday’s game. Expect Indiana to have a renewed focus on that end of the floor.

6. When Marcus Morris is good, the entire offense opens up significantly. The Celtics just need him to shoot reasonably well. He can create his own shot when the clock is winding down, but most importantly, he can knock down spot-up triples -- per the NBA’s (occasionally questionable) tracking data, Morris hits 42.9 percent of his 3-pointers with zero dribbles.

7. Earlier this year, Morris talked about how the team wasn’t having fun. Since, the bench unit has been visibly more enthusiastic (perhaps the funniest moment in Game 1 was after Al Horford bounced in a 3-pointer and shrugged, the entire bench turned to one another and fake shrugged to celebrate the three as well).

So has there been a renewed focus on fun -- or has Morris noticed an uptick in the morale around the team recently?

8. Nope. When I asked him about it on Tuesday, he said everything is completely different in the playoffs, and the comments about fun don’t really apply any more.

“We’re not worried about having fun, we’re worried about executing and X’s and O’s,"" Morris said. ""Guys understand that. We’re out here competing. I think it’s bigger than having fun right now. During the season, you have fun because you have ups and downs. Right now, it’s not time for ups and downs.”

An extremely fair point. Question (and attempted story line) withdrawn.

9. In the absence of Victor Oladipo, much was made of how the Celtics would deal with Bojan Bogdanovic, Indiana’s new leading scorer. Those questions intensified when Marcus Smart was ruled out for the series, since Smart was easily Boston’s best defender against Bogdanovic, with his ability to maneuver around screens and bother/contest shooters.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/bendowsett/2019/04/17/the-utah-jazzs-offense-is-their-true-problem-against-houston/#322c434c3187,"Houston blew out Utah in Game 1 of their first-round playoff rematch Sunday night, and most of the resulting conversation has been about one end of the floor. Rightly so.

The Rockets decisively won this first battle between the NBA’s 2nd-best offense and its best defense during the regular season (figures per Cleaning the Glass), mostly by exploiting a highly exaggerated defensive scheme Utah attempted against reigning MVP James Harden.

To this eye, and those of several close to the team, the pendulum swings toward execution here. The Jazz have played a similar defensive style against the Rockets at times this year, even if the league seems content to credit the tactic to Milwaukee or San Antonio; it sure doesn’t look like what we saw on Sunday night, and can have some success when it’s properly calibrated.

Utah can and should be better on this end. They’ve actually held the Rockets below their average offensive efficiency figure in eight of the teams’ last 10 matchups dating back to last year’s five-game series. It’s clear they have the personnel to keep Houston in check, at least as much as anyone else in the league can.


If anything, Game 1 this time around should concern the Jazz more on the other end of the floor. They posted a putrid 89.1 points scored per-100-possessions Sunday night, per NBA.com, this after averaging exactly 100 against the Rockets in four regular season matchups. The Chicago Bulls were the only team in the league this season to post a worse efficiency against Houston’s below-average defense.

The Jazz also earned just a 100.4 offensive rating over five games against Houston the playoffs last year. Put it all together, and we now have 10 games and nearly 500 minutes of play telling us the Jazz simply can’t score on this Rockets team.

YOU MAY ALSO LIKE
Why?

The answer begins with shot-making, that constant Jazz pest back to gnaw at them. Utah attempted 21 open or wide open threes Sunday night and made just six, per Second Spectrum data on NBA.com, for a 28.5 percent clip – they shot about 36 percent on these looks for the year.

Advanced tracking data provided by a source paints an even starker picture: The Jazz’s expected effective field goal percentage, a figure based on shot location, defender distance and other detailed factors, was second-best for any game played so far in these NBA playoffs (behind only the Rockets’ own figure during the same game, which was just decimals higher). But while the Rockets capitalized on their great shot selection and even outperformed their expected percentages for a dominant showing, the Jazz were over 10 full points below theirs.

“Make more shots” applies to most NBA teams when they lose, though. Utah’s offensive issues against Houston run deeper.

For starters, credit to the Rockets as a group. It doesn’t take a defensive juggernaut to spot and exploit the weak spots in Utah’s offense, and Houston has consistently done well here with varying personnel. Their scouting is strong – watch them totally shut down one of Quin Snyder’s favorite go-to sets, a little fake pindown screen that typically results in a Rudy Gobert dunk or a wide open corner three:"
https://earlybirdrights.com/2019/04/17/utah-jazz-houston-rockets-james-harden-defense-milwaukee-bucks-nba-playoffs/,"A lot has been made of various teams’ strategies to defend James Harden, with a lot of focus on the Milwaukee Bucks, who broke out a very unconventional tactic to ensure Harden had to drive into the paint, where Brook Lopez waited with arms raised to contest any shot at the rim and make Harden’s floaters more difficult. However, having Eric Bledsoe contest from behind and Lopez protect the rim wasn’t the end of the Bucks’ strategy; the other three defenders on the court are integrally involved in the scheme as well, with the key objective being to dissuade Harden from throwing passes to a shooter in either corner as he dribbled into the paint. Mike Prada wrote a great breakdown of how the Bucks were able to succeed in containing Harden in their matchups with the Rockets this season.

In Game 1 of their series against Houston, the Utah Jazz employed a very similar strategy. By stationing their on-ball defenders on Harden’s left shoulder, they were able to prevent his famous step back jumper and had Rudy Gobert playing the Brook Lopez role, only with more length and better defensive instincts. The Jazz don’t have anybody on the perimeter with the combination of strength and quickness Bledsoe possesses, but they do have Gobert, who can make up for anything extra Harden gets as a result of Utah’s less capable perimeter defenders. Utah’s on-ball defenders did their jobs against Harden, funneling him correctly toward Gobert and relying on their system to stymy him.

However, the bigger problem for Utah came elsewhere in Game 1 – they weren’t able to execute a modified version of Milwaukee’s strategy due to poor off-ball defense and a poor understanding of Harden’s particular passing skills. As has been pointed out elsewhere, most notably by Mike Zavagno on Twitter, Harden is at his best throwing the ball either even with his body or in front of him on a drive; he’s not particularly great at seeing an open man behind him and making the pass to the wing if he’s already past the free throw line on a drive to the rim. Milwaukee knows this, so they move their wing defenders with Harden as he drives, taking away the corner pass and relying on their length and recovery speed to get back to the wing if he does make that pass. Of course, it helps that they have Giannis Antetokounmpo on their team, who can essentially be in two places at once defensively, which changes how the Bucks rotate defensively against Harden’s isolation drives. Utah doesn’t have anybody who can replicate what Antetokounmpo brings defensively, but they can modify what the Bucks were able to do in order to put up more resistance against Harden in Game 2 and beyond.

Utah’s strategy in Game 1 was to put the on-ball defender on Harden’s left shoulder and allow him to drive into Gobert, with one of the corner defenders sinking in onto Capela to essentially box him out from being able to go up for an easy lob. This freed Gobert to focus solely on Harden, rather than having to play the “will he, won’t he?” game with the lob to Capela. Sinking a defender in also helped clean up the glass for the Jazz, as that guy would continue to box out as the shot went up. The issues arose elsewhere for the Jazz, as the defender sinking in on Capela needs to be helped in the corner.

When done correctly, the Rockets had precious few options other than Harden’s contested floater over Gobert:


The key is Mitchell – he has to drop with Harden to prevent the pass to the corner, otherwise it’s too easy for the Rockets to create consistent opportunities from beyond the arc.


Herein lies the problem for Utah: it’s difficult to ask Mitchell to help off of Eric Gordon, who can space the floor out to nearly half court, but the other side of that coin is giving up an open corner three to P.J. Tucker, who was near the league leaders in corner three-point shooting. To combat this, Utah should fully rotate, with Mitchell following Harden on the drive to take away the corner three and Ricky Rubio, who is guarding Danuel House at the top of the key, following Mitchell’s movements to rotate over to Gordon. This leaves House undefended for a time, but there are advantages to this for Utah. House is a worse shooter from the top of the key than Tucker is from the corner or Gordon is from the wing and the pass to House is a difficult one for Harden to make, because Ingles is literally standing behind Harden as he drives to the rim. Should the pass float over Ingles to get to House, then he’s within a step or two of contesting that shot or switching onto House for the time being. If Ingles takes House, then it’s up to someone else to defend Harden, but that’s where Sefolosha comes in; his job is done on Capela in the dunker spot, so he now steps up to take Harden and the Utah defense is no worse off than they were before.

Further complications arise when Harden drives where three of his teammates are waiting, while Capela is along in the dunker spot with nobody in the near corner to sink down onto him. In a heavy-rotation strategy, it would be up to the lowest defender to navigate his way across the paint and box out Capela anyway, then step up to Harden if he makes a pass out or continue to box out on a Harden shot attempt over Gobert.


Sefolosha and Gobert are both waiting for Harden in the restricted area, opening Capela on the cut for an easy finish. It seems counter-intuitive for Sefolosha to help so far away from his original mark, but once Harden commits to his drive, the rotation is on for Utah and Sefolosha needn’t be concerned with Tucker in the corner; that’s Mitchell’s job now. Sefolosha’s new job is to ensure Capela doesn’t get the ball, either on a pass or on the offensive glass, with his secondary job being to step up to defend Harden if Houston’s MVP passes it out to the perimeter and resets the offense. The rest of the Jazz will rotate as need be: Mitchell sinks into the corner to take Tucker, Rubio follows him to defend Gordon’s spot-up threat, and Ingles, who is already behind Harden and between him and House, is able to both contest Harden’s floater from behind and be in position to close out to House if needed.

A heavy-rotation strategy would bring with it issues based on the alignment of Houston’s perimeter players. In the above example, Harden is driving from the right side of the floor and all three of the Rockets’ other perimeter guys are lined up on the left side: corner, wing, and top of the key. What if Harden is driving from the top and his teammates are spread out with two in each corner and one on the wing?


This is a problem for Utah, as Jae Crowder has to sink down onto Capela, but there’s no defender to take Tucker in that circumstance. To expect Ingles, who is guarding Chris Paul at the top of the key, to drop down to defend Tucker might be asking a bit too much, but if the Jazz were to commit to a heavy-rotation defense, then that’s likely what would have to happen. If Harden flips the ball back to Paul, then Rubio is Paul’s new defender and Crowder disengages with Capela to pick up Harden, though Ingles can also take Harden based on where he goes after making the pass back to Paul, with Crowder getting back out to Tucker. This is more tenuous for the Jazz, as Ingles would have drop way off of Paul in order to get this done, which isn’t necessarily something teams like to do, for good reason. It would also put a lot of weight on Rubio’s shoulders – contesting from behind on Harden and being responsible for closing out and defending Paul might be too much for one player to handle, even if that player is Ricky Rubio.

The bet Utah would be making in that spot is that Harden won’t see or make that pass to Paul. He’s never been particularly adept at throwing the ball behind him to the perimeter and, at the very least, it would make him less comfortable with knowing exactly where the open man is.

The most difficult setup for Utah to defend is when the single shooter is in the right corner and Capela is stationed in the dunker spot on the right side of the rim."

Why do the best defenders in basketball slip through the cracks?

One of the many curious things about the billion-dollar labor market better known as the NBA is how many of the world’s greatest basketball players were told at one point or another that they weren’t good enough.

They weren’t recruited by top colleges out of high school. They found themselves living halfway across the world eating borscht after they weren’t drafted by NBA teams.

All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns has retained his optimism and stayed committed to the Wolves amid the team’s chaos.

Late in the Timberwolves season, Karl-Anthony Towns professed optimism about where the Wolves were as a team, even though they had missed the playoffs for the third time in his four pro seasons.

“I think we’re heading up,” Towns said. “You’ve seen the team heading down, not in the best of spots and then you’re seeing it in a good spot. I think we’re going the right direction, from all aspects.”

Towns didn’t say it, but one of the reasons for optimism amid a tempestuous season was Towns’ play, specifically the second half of the season. After signing his maximum, five-year contract extension in September amid the Jimmy Butler trade drama, Towns quieted any lingering doubt over his long-term commitment to the Wolves.

He had a rocky start to the season, and while Towns always downplayed his early struggles having anything to do with Butler, the numbers suggest otherwise. While Butler was still with the team, Towns averaged 19.9 points per game on 46% shooting. Compare that to the rest of the season: 25.3 points per game on 53% shooting.

After Towns returned from a car accident that cost him two games after the All-Star break, his year really took off — even as the Wolves’ playoff hopes crumpled. He averaged 28.1 points and 13.4 rebounds on 53% shooting. It was that stretch that may have earned Towns millions of dollars more on his next contract.

Timberwolves front office search update
Two names emerged as potential candidates in the Wolves' search for a president of basketball operations. ESPN reported the Wolves were set to meet with Clippers General Manager Michael Winger while the Houston Chronicle reported the team also received permission to speak with Rockets Vice President Gersson Rosas.
If Towns makes an All-NBA team, it will be his second All-NBA team while he was playing on his rookie contract. That would trigger the so-called “Rose Rule,” named after Wolves free agent Derrick Rose, which says that a player with Towns’ amount of service time could make up to 30% of the salary cap for a single season as opposed to 25% if, among other caveats, he was named MVP once, an All-Star starter or All-NBA twice.

Achieving All-NBA status again would mean making around $190 million as opposed to $156 million, adding a little more stress for the Wolves as it pertains to the salary cap. Towns said contract implications didn’t motivate his second-half surge, which also coincided with interim coach Ryan Saunders getting his promotion in early January. After taking over, Saunders said he wanted the Wolves to play with a faster tempo and shoot more three-pointers.

That didn’t happen. Under Saunders, the Wolves played at a slower pace (101.2 possessions compared to 100.8) and only shot slightly more threes (29 to 28.5 per game) than they had under Tom Thibodeau. Perhaps some of that has to do with revolving the offense around Towns. Getting a center his shots can require ball movement and time for him to operate in the post, both of which extend possessions.

Towns is a capable three-point shooter, and shot 40% on 4.6 attempts per game this year, but perhaps it was telling that the Wolves took 42 threes — their third-most all season — in a game against the Raptors on April 9, one of the two games Towns sat out at the end of the season. If Saunders is named the permanent coach, the offense might have to undergo some tweaks if Saunders wants to accomplish his goals of more threes and a faster pace while not diminishing Towns’ role.

Overall, Towns was happy with where the Wolves were at late in the season under Saunders’ direction.

“Stability is such a big, key component of winning in the NBA,” Towns said. “So, hopefully, this summer we can find that stability and that culture, staff and everything. And find a way to come back ready to go and have a head start.”"

Developing an understanding of what made the Knicks tick on offense this season
By Buffalo 66@AmicoDallas  Apr 13, 2019, 8:00am EDT

Erik Williams-USA TODAY Sports
Much hullabaloo has been made about the state of the Knicks’ offense this year. We’ve all heard or asked variations of the following questions: Is it too isolation-heavy? Is there a system? Where is the ball and player movement? Is David Fizdale — pissed off that EA doesn’t make NBA Street anymore — just trying to get Trier to bust out a Level 2 Gamebreaker on some poor defender? And so on.

In part one of this two-part article, I’ll identify and explain several concepts that the Knicks rely on in their offense, and try to figure out whether those leading questions are leading anywhere reasonable.

The stats
Let’s start by taking a look at a few stats that will help give us a general overview of the offense.

(Some of these stats are a few weeks dated because I’ve been working on this piece for a while. Fortunately little of significance has happened since I collected these.)

A good place to start is with team offensive rating (ORTG). This is a calculation of the number of points an offense scores per 100 possessions, and it provides a nice bite-sized overview of the health of the offense. The Knicks have an ORTG of 104.3, which is good for last in the NBA. For comparison, the Warriors lead the league with a robust ORTG of 114.7, and the median NBA team ORTG is 109.5 (as of March 7). To the surprise of no one, the Knicks’ offense is not healthy.

Let’s dig a bit deeper. First, let’s chat about ball and player movement. It’s commonly thought that lots of both of these are essential for a healthy offense. That’s straightforwardly false. In fact, over the last few seasons, offensive ball and player movement have been negatively correlated with offensive rating, and many of the league’s best offenses have very little of either — consider this year’s iso-heavy iterations of the Rockets and Thunder, for example. That said, there are excellent NBA offenses that thrive off of ball and player movement (e.g. the 76ers and the Warriors). The bottom line is that there is no single recipe for excellent offense.

So where do the Knicks fall with respect to these stats? Right in the middle of the pack. As of March 7, they were 18th in passes made per game and tied for 17th in miles run on the offensive side of the ball per game.

In a bit, I’ll use film to explain where most of this ball and player movement comes from within the offense. But first, there’s a bit more to be said about their passing statistics. Quite frankly, they’re atrocious. Despite moving around a fair bit and passing the ball quite a bit, they produce assists like a team that neither moves nor passes. In fact, the Knicks average fewer assists per game (20.1) than any other team (the Rockets average the second-fewest).

Even worse, they have the statistical profile of a team that doesn’t capitalize on the advantages they create. So, for example, while they average a decent 44.9 drives per game (good for 13th in the NBA), they almost never pass out of those drives (they have the second-worst pass percentage on drives). When they do, it’s usually with little success (they sport the NBA’s worst assist percentage on drives). But the problems don’t stop there. Even when they make good passes off drives, the team is terrible at swinging the ball to the open man. This is reflected by the fact that they have the third-fewest secondary assists per game (2.3). Per NBA.com, “a player is awarded a secondary assist if they passed the ball to a player who recorded an assist within one second and without dribbling”.

The Knicks also lack any high-level individual creators. In general, NBA players are not efficient isolation scorers. Even the very best isolation scorers often average fewer points per possession (PPP) in isolation than their teams do as a whole. This is true of James Harden, for example, the most efficient volume isolation scorer in the NBA. On isolation attempts that result in him shooting he averages 1.11 PPP. If every one of the the Rockets’ shots came off a Harden iso attempt, the Rockets would have a league average offense. But when the Rockets work together to create advantages that result in better shots, they significantly outperform Harden’s solo mark. Specifically, they average a whopping 1.14 PPP. And they do this even though many of those shots come from shooters who are much worse than Harden.

Of course, because of Harden’s skill, the Rockets able to create advantages out of isolation sets. Harden is able to collapse a defense and demand second and third defenders help off their men, which allows the Rockets shooters to come open without much in the way of ball or player movement.

The Knicks’ best isolation scorers/shot creators pale in comparison to Harden, so they do not have this luxury. Here are the Knicks’ top five iso scorers: Trier (1 PPP), Vonleh (.88 PPP), Mudiay (.81 PPP), DSJ (.81 PPP), and Ntilikina (.76 PPP). Quite clearly, the Knicks do better (1.04 PPP) when they work together to create advantages that result in better shots.

Not surprisingly (given their terrible passing and lack of a high-level shot creator) the Knicks do not create very many open shots. Only 47.7 percent of the Knicks’ shots are listed by NBA.com as either wide open (no defender within six feet of the shooter) or open (closest defender within 4-6 feet). If you don’t pay attention to these sorts of numbers, you might think that this seems... good? Nearly half of the Knicks shots are open or wide open?! But, lo and behold, the Knicks are bottom feeders. Only four teams create fewer wide or wide open shots than the Knicks. (If you’re curious, the Boston Celtics lead the NBA — about 57 percent of their shots are open or wide open. Yowzers).

Alright, so the Knicks have a terrible ORTG, and that’s probably heavily influenced by the fact that they are a terrible passing team which doesn’t have a high level initiator or shot creator and as a result they don’t generate enough open shots. So far... not surprising.

The film
In this section I want to do a couple of things. First, I want to chat a bit about the concepts that structure the Knicks offense. While the Knicks — like every team — run some set plays, there are a number of offensive sets the Knicks go back to time and time again. I’ll offer a brief overview about how a few of these work, and what the Knicks are trying to achieve with them.

Let me start by noting that I don’t have access to fancy Synergy data. Below I’ll say some things like: “the Knicks often start their possessions with this action...” Since I don’t have access to the fancy data, these claims will be based off my observations. As a result, these will be ball park claims, and should be understood as such.

The concepts
Pin-downs
Pin-down screens are a staple of many NBA offenses, and the Knicks follow suit here. In a pin-down screen, the screener faces the baseline and attempts to “pin” a teammate’s defender to that spot, while their teammate sprints away from the baseline. In this (somewhat blurry) image you can see Mitchell Robinson setting a pin-down screen for Kevin Knox."

Greg Oden had been drinking all day, morning until night, as he did every day. He would take his final sip and fall into a dark oblivion every night. He would wake up and go straight for a bottle to get through the next day. Every time he ate, he would throw up.

The life of the No. 1 pick in the 2007 NBA draft had been whittled down to nothing more than a shell of an existence. Oden huddled in a dark house nearly 10 years after that triumphant moment, isolated, with alcohol-induced bulimia.

Oden, then 28, would stare at the television screen, watching clips of the player drafted No. 2 behind him, Kevin Durant, now a league superstar. The tears would flow.

He would watch the old NBA YouTube clips of himself, knowing he shouldn't. He would sob.

Oden, who was plagued with injuries throughout his seven years in the league before knee ailments ended his NBA career, still heard the words echo: ""Greg Oden is the biggest bust in the NBA.""

Failure pulsed through his body. He had so much sadness. So much disappointment.

During those dark, hollow days he believed there was no way to survive other than to make all the failure and regret disappear.

""You just keep on numbing yourself with alcohol,"" said Oden, now 31, ""trying not to think about it."" 

Setting an example
Inside the Union of Ohio State University, a bustling place where students drink lattes and click away on laptops, Oden talked this week about those dark days. He will never forget them.

As he spoke, a student approached to ask if Oden would pose for a photo with him. Oden's still got it. People still want a piece  of him."
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/enes-kanter-is-at-the-center-of-it-all.html,"It’s been a long season for Enes Kanter, one that began in a Knicks jersey and today has him in Portland red, but the friendly giant looks relaxed winding down a recent practice with his new team. He’s blending in, launching jumpers, playing the part of an NBA player, which is really all he set out to be.

Yet he knows that blending in is a privilege he loses as soon as he is done shooting. For the past three years, Kanter has waged a media campaign against the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for the dismantling of human rights in his home country. Hardly a week has passed without him appearing on cable news or in the press, hardly a practice without a reporter prompting Kanter to recite the record of Erdoğan’s oppression. His efforts to enter Turkey’s crisis into the American mainstream have been an astonishing success. But the endeavor has also cost him. His seventh season has been the first in which the specter of the Erdoğan threat has compromised his work on the court.

This was the first year, in other words, that Kanter missed a game out of concern he would be killed — assassinated by Erdoğan’s goons or rogue loyalists — if he set foot outside the United States. Turkish courts convicted him in absentia of terrorism in 2017; in advance of the Knicks’ trip to London this past January, the country reportedly issued a warrant with Interpol for his arrest. For that game, as well as one against the Toronto Raptors, Kanter stayed in New York.

So, after an occasionally moody stint in New York ended with the last-place Knicks buying out his contract, the brawny seven-footer latched onto the Blazers, a team hurtling toward the postseason with a void at center. (Jusuf Nurkic, who had been a force on the interior, broke his leg in late March.) He’s absorbed in the work of fitting in, learning new schemes and new teammates on the fly, removed from the media spotlight and playing meaningful ball again.

“We were thinking about like, if we can get a win or not in New York,” he says after shootaround. “Here we’re like, let’s get in the playoffs. All you think about is get to the playoffs.”

The playoff push has allowed Kanter to sideline at least some of his off-court stress. He’s fit in with the Blazers roster, a loose bunch he called high-character. But the stress continues to mount anyway: his father, who still lives in Istanbul, will soon be going on trial, and that’s weighing on him, too.

“What he’s facing is being my dad,” he says. “Of course it’s always in my head. It’s tough to play basketball and think about, My dad might be in jail for 15 years.”

Long loath to betray the gravity of his protest, Kanter’s eternal sunshine has finally caught a few clouds. He sighs.

In the U.S., Kanter is a lovable galoot, a journeyman center with a penchant for post play and offensive rebounding, known for playful smack talk and fawning teammate PDA. To many in his home country, however, Kanter is part of a conspiracy to overthrow Turkish democracy. Erdoğan claims that Fethullah Gülen, the founder of an Islamic movement called the Hizmet, ordered a coup attempt in 2016 that sent the country into a tailspin. Gülen’s influence has loomed over Turkish civic life for decades, and Kanter, an avowed disciple, visits him regularly at his Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, compound. Though Gülen and Kanter have both condemned the coup attempt, it’s their word against the president’s in a country without a free press.

https://www.gq.com/story/zhaire-smith-76ers-deadly-allergic-reaction,"It was mid-November 2018, and Zhaire Smith didn’t recognize himself in the mirror. His face was gaunt, his arms gangly, his once-200-pound, 6’5” frame reduced to a barely-there 160 pounds. Four tubes protruded from his stomach and chest—one for feeding, the rest to keep fluids from draining into his lungs. After spending six weeks at the hospital, where he was in and out of consciousness and at the mercy of a morphine drip to keep the pain down, he was finally home.

Today, at the close of the NBA regular season, the 19-year-old first-round pick has leapfrogged into the Philadelphia 76ers’ rotation. To date, only his family really knows what happened when an intense allergic reaction in September hospitalized Zhaire, leaving him weak and unable to eat, and what it took for Zhaire to make it back to the court. But in late March, at the team’s practice facility, he joined his mom Andrea and step-father Aundre to explain the medical emergency that could’ve ended his career—or worse.

It starts in preschool, and Zhaire says his mom has told the story a million times: Another little kid rubbed peanut butter on him, which made his eyes swell shut and caused him to break out in hives. Tests revealed allergies to, basically, all nuts. Still, he grew into a talented multi-sport athlete and eventually embraced basketball, sprouting into a wiry defensive presence at Lakeview Centennial High School in Garland, Texas. He was a three-star recruit, ranked No. 194 in his class, when he committed to Texas Tech. “I didn’t have hoop dreams,” he says. “I thought I was going to go four years in college, probably make some money overseas, and take care of my family.”"
https://hashtagbasketball.com/orlando-magic/content/jonathan-isaac-his-stretch-four-potential,"Jonathan Isaac already has a solid all-around game, but is still a project in many ways. His ceiling will depend on whether he can develop from solid to elite in key areas.

Written by Nick Agar-Johnson (@NBAJohnson) on 13 April 2019

When Jonathan Isaac put his name in for the 2017 NBA Draft after one season at Florida State, he was a bit of a project player. At 6'10"" with a 7'4"" wingspan and solid lateral mobility, he had incredible defensive upside. His future on the offensive end was slightly less obvious, but the upside was quite intriguing.

Most project players have one or two truly spectacular skills and a ton of weaknesses. They might be spectacular athletes with no feel for the game, or passing savants with no concept of defense, or dead-eye shooters with defensive chops and a complete inability to dribble.

Jonathan Isaac is not a typical project player. His game is more remarkable for the wide variety of things that he does decently well. He's a solid defender who makes up for his skinny frame with good instincts and good lateral mobility. He doesn't have a go-to shot or a primary scorer's mentality, but he's a decent 3-point shooter who can put the ball on the floor when opponents close out on him too aggressively.

Isaac struggled through injuries in his rookie season but is back on track after a solid sophomore season that saw him grab a starting spot for Orlando in their first playoff appearance since 2012. While he is questionable for their opening game against the Toronto Raptors due to a concussion, Isaac has the best chance of anyone to be the X-factor in an improbable, but not completely impossible, Toronto upset. Even if Isaac can't carry his team out of the first round of the playoffs, his all-around game makes him a key piece of the future for a team on the rise in central Florida.

Offense: Primary Stretch-Four
Jonathan Isaac was not a primary scoring option in college, and he almost certainly will never be one in the NBA. He can fill a number of holes for a team offensively depending on the talent around him, but that ""depending on the talent around him"" phrase is really the most important part for a jack-of-all-trades player like Isaac. He may never even ascend to secondary option status, and in many ways profiles as a role player on that end of the floor.

The key variable in his future will be his three-point shooting. Isaac only made 32.3% of his triples this season, but he did cast up a healthy percentage of his looks from beyond the arc--43.5% of his shots this season came from long range. His solid free throw shooting (at 81.5% this year) and mechanically sound jumper make it seem like Isaac can continue to boost those numbers from deep as he adjusts to the NBA game, especially if he can be more than a catch-and-shoot threat:



Isaac doesn't need to be a spectacular shooter to stick around in the NBA. As with much of his skill set, he's already reached a baseline level of shooting that will allow him to carve out a long NBA career. He's also an excellent transition player, ranking in the 87th percentile on the break per Synergy Sports.

However, a healthy jump in 3-point percentage could mean the difference between solid starter and All-Star level talent. If Isaac can get to above-average from range (say 37% or 38% from deep), that will open up more driving lanes as teams are forced to commit more aggressively to keep him inside the arc. From there, Isaac can work on his handle or try to improve his passing vision to take advantage of more scrambled defensive looks.

Defense: Switching Paradise
Even though he did show promise as a stretch-four while in college, Jonathan Isaac was drafted for his defensive impact. While he still needs to bulk up to be an effective defender down low, Isaac has the size to contest shots near the rim and the quick feet to stick with smaller players on the perimeter. Isaac finished 20th in the league in blocks this season and 17th in Block Percentage per Basketball-Reference. He was also effective as a weak-side shot blocker in addition to keeping his own man's shots away from the rim. He excels at recovering to his man, and tempting them into searching for looks that aren't as open as his opponents might believe:"
https://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2019/4/15/18311214/valley-loses-bright-light-as-former-phoenix-suns-coach-john-macleod-passes-away,"We are sad to note that this past weekend, former Suns head coach John MacLeod joined the late Connie Hawkins and Cotton Fitzsimmons as Suns Ring of Honor members who have passed on.

MacLeod won more games as head coach of the Phoenix Suns than any of the other 18 head coaches in franchise history, but could not win this battle against a so-far incurable Alzheimer’s disease.

MacLeod, the head coach from 1973-1987, more than doubles up all those 18 other Suns coaches in seasons (14), games (1,122), wins (579), playoff games (81) and playoff wins (37). They reached the playoffs eight straight seasons in the middle of that run, but missed them in final three.

He was the head coach when I first moved to Phoenix in the summer of 1983 and started following the team on the local cable channels and daily articles in the morning paper. I fell in love with the Suns only pro sports franchise back then and my love has never wavered.

The team I loved was terrible — four straight playoff misses, drug scandals, etc. — but I was there to connect with a team and the players and that’s what local sports coverage was all about back then.

I wasn’t inundated with constant negativity around a team where half the roster was implicated in a drug-running scandal. John MacLeod’s firing was mostly a quiet “letting go” while moving on to the next chapter. The news coverage focused on Jerry Colangelo buying the team and promising to clean it all up. We mostly forget that it was General Manager Colangelo himself who built that deeply flawed team — morally and physically — because back then the papers weren’t all about scandal. The first story that came up on a google search on MacLeod’s firing came from the LA Times, in fact.

But Colangelo righted that ship indeed after buying the team to make sure they wouldn’t get sold to someone who’d relocate them elsewhere. He cleaned out all the bad blood and even the collaterally damaged staff, including the long-tenured and highly successful coach he subjected that awful roster to.

MacLeod went on to coach a couple more years here and there, and was eventually named to the Suns Ring of Honor nearly 30 years later, and well after Colangelo sold the team to Robert Sarver.

MacLeod coached the Suns to eight straight playoff appearances in the late-70s and early-80s, including a pair of Conference Finals and an NBA Finals appearance. It was MacLeod’s team that pushed the vaunted Celtics to six games and almost stole that series if not for a phantom timeout call that should have been a technical.

Remember the recent Suns-Pelicans game where Alvin Gentry called timeout TWICE in overtime when he didn’t have any left, and finally the refs couldn’t play it off anymore and had to penalize the Pelicans by giving the Suns a technical free throw and the ball?

Yeah, that’s exactly what Red Auerbach did in the 1976 Finals, except the refs ignored the timeout request and the Celtics ultimately won the triple-overtime thriller and tilt the series squarely in the Celtics favor. You might even forget about Paul Westphal’s timeout call that DID result in a tech but allowed the Suns to inbound midcourt and feed the “Shot Heard Round the World” to force another overtime. Many still call that one of the greatest games ever played. Read up on your history here.

Watch it below. The video doesn’t show how it went from a one-point Celtics lead to Gar Heard tying it on that crazy jumper, but it was Westphal’s ingenious timeout attempt that gave the Celtics a two-point lead instead of one.

Crazy, crazy game! I get goose bumps watching it now."
http://www.howtocoachyouthbasketball.com/coaching-youth-basketball-blog.html,"Game after game we see the same thing. Full court zone press, both teams, with a double, triple team on every pass. Rush, hurry, panic, coach screaming and the game just started. What is the heck are we trying to do out there on the floor.

If the ball does make it over half court, the defensive team is surely back in some type of zone “defense”. Standings, watching, straight legs no stance, just waiting to pounce on that weak pass from the little scared kid on offense that just doesn't have the strength to play in this environment. Coach and parents screaming “hands up”, “get him” ,“trap”!

Sure, there are maybe two kids that are enjoying this game, That would be the big ones that are overly mature and developed for this age. Almost everyone at the game is intense, screaming, uncomfortable, and I am just talking about the parents and grandparents in the stands.

Without question, the team that gets the trophies at the end of the tournament, is the team with the highest number of big, overly mature, aggressive kids, that can have “success” playing this way. Sure they win, but in the process of playing this way, they learn very little and don’t get better at the skills of the game.

And these youth coaches, they seem to want to control and manipulate EVERY pass and possession. Not with basketball instruction, not with encouragement for team play, but yelling, screaming, to get that ball from the poor little kids that just can’t compete and physically play in what can accurately be described as a jungle with wild animals trying to kill you.

There are exceptions in every gym. Coaches that want to teach and let the kids play stand out like beacons in the gym. No, these are not always the teams that win the trophies, but they are the coaches and teams that make you think the game has a future for skilled players willing to work at becoming fundamentally sound basketball players.

Is it any wonder WHY that 70% of kids playing basketball stop playing when they are 13 years old. The two main reasons - it is not fun, I am not good enough. No surprise here."

http://team.fastmodelsports.com/,"There is no doubt that offensive rebounding can aid your overall efficiency as an offense. It creates extra opportunities for an offense and can produce high quality looks versus a scrambling defense. For teams that do not shoot the ball particularly well it would seem that offensive rebounding should take on an even more important role. They would seem to need those extra opportunities in order to maintain the kind of offensive efficiency that is necessary to win games.

The problem with stutter steps 
Posted on August 2, 2018
Originally published in Hard2Guard Player Development Newsletter, 8.15. Subscribe here.

I attended a college practice, and the team practiced closeouts. Fake Fundamentals explains my philosophy on the traditional closeout. This drill mixed short and long closeouts depending on one’s starting position, and the staff treated them the same. Players ran a few steps and stutter-stepped to close the distance to one arm’s length from the attacker. Because it was a  non-competitive shell drill, nobody gave up an open shot or was beaten on the drive. The closeouts worked!  […]

BBR Blog Runs out the Clock
Posted by Sean Forman on November 1, 2011

One of the tough parts of running a business is deciding when to put more effort into something and when to not. We know we've been pretty silent here since the end of the season, and after a lot of internal debate, we've decided to stop posting editorial content on the BBR blog.

This obviously has nothing to do with the quality of the content produced by lead writer, Neil Paine. His posts were phenomenal, and I know many readers looked forward to them every week. A big thanks to Neil for making this such a vital place for basketball discussion and analysis. As a small company, focus is vital for our success, and we are choosing to focus our energy on pumping out as much statistical basketball data as possible and that means cutting back in other areas.

None of the existing content is going to go away. We'll keep it up here for as long as the site is open (which we intend to be a very long time). If you would like to contact Neil, he's available at np@sports-reference.com."

The Spartans last reached the second weekend in 2015, and suffering a 15-over-2 upset one year later. But that Middle Tennessee team was better than this Bradley squad, which was the No. 5 seed in a down Missouri Valley. The Braves made their last NCAA trip in 2006 — as an at-large in the year of the Valley and mid-major — going all the way to the Sweet Sixteen as a 13.

No. 11 Belmont Bruins (27-5, OVC at-large, First Four winner) vs.
No. 6 Maryland Terrapins (22-10, Big Ten at-large)

KenPom predicted score: Maryland 76, Belmont 72

Watchability rank within window: 2nd

Tuesday’s win over the Temple was Belmont’s first in eight NCAA appearances and they’ll look to double that total against a Maryland team that returns after a season away. The Terps’ last victory (over Hawai’i) came in 2016’s run to the Sweet Sixteen.

No. 13 Northeastern Huskies (23-10, CAA automatic bid) vs.
No. 4 Kansas Jayhawks (25-9, Big 12 at-large)

KenPom predicted score: KU 78, Northeastern 68

Watchability rank within window: 3rd

Northeastern gave Notre Dame a fright in a 3/14 game in 2015, falling by just four to the Fighting Irish in their last NCAA appearance, which was their first in 24 years. The Huskies last won a tournament game in 1984, in the preliminary round! That track record naturally doesn’t compare to a Kansas team that last missed the tourney in 1989 — the result of a postseason ban. The Jayhawks reached the Final Four in 2018 and last failed to win at least on tournament game in 2006.

No. 12 Murray State Racers (27-4, OVC automatic bid) vs.
No. 5 Marquette Golden Eagles (24-9, Big East at-large)

KenPom predicted score: Marquette 76, Murray State 72

Watchability rank within window: 1st

Odd that both OVC teams would be scheduled in the same window.

With two of the most dynamic players in the country, Murray State’s Ja Morant and Marquette’s Markus Howard, involved, this West region matchup is the most anticipated one of the day. While this is the second NCAA trip in as many years for the Racers, they last won a game in 2012, as a six seed. Oddly enough, Marquette is the team that eliminated Murray State in the round of 32. As for the Golden Eagles, they’re back after a year away, though their last victory came in a 2013 run to the Elite Eight under Buzz Williams.

https://www.bloggersodear.com/2019/3/22/18272127/breaking-danny-manning-to-return-to-wake-forest-ron-wellman-ruined-legacy,"Although many believed this to be the final year of his tenure in Winston-Salem, Manning has been granted another year to try to turn around what has been a miserable five years (and decade) for Wake Forest basketball.

I am not going to sugarcoat this or be unnecessarily negative, but it should come as no surprise to anybody who has read me on Blogger So Dear or on Twitter that I believe this is a horrific decision and will ostracize an already apathetic fan base who is steadfastly devoted to Wake Forest basketball, and that, to me, is just very sad.

Manning has graduated one four-year player during his time at Wake Forest (Mitchell Wilbekin) and despite two top-thirty recruiting classes nationally, has set the Demon Deacons up as a revolving door of student-athletes over the past three years due to transfers and players leaving for professional basketball.

I do want to say, there is a lot of talent on this roster and a lot of student-athletes that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this season. The team didn’t give up at all during a tough year, and I truly believe that a lot of these kids have the talent and motivation to play professional basketball.

I am proud of what they did for Wake Forest this season, especially how they represented Mother So Dear on the floor, and it is horrible that there isn’t a great way to distinguish the disdain that people feel for what is going on right now with the program and how people feel about the players as a whole.

Everything that I have heard from folks close to the program indicates that the contract extension given last year by Ron Wellman to Danny Manning was simply too much to overcome to make a move this off-season. Although we will likely never know the specifics of the details, nor what went on in the meetings between the AD and Manning in the past few days, I believe that by keeping Manning it will ultimately prove to be a worse financial decision than cutting ties with a bad contract and bad fit and moving on.

The words of the athletic department, media relations, and everybody involved with Wake Forest as far as payroll goes just ring extremely hollow right now. There is no dedication to winning, there is no commitment to improving, and those making phone calls to Wake Forest alums, donors, and simply fans will find it extremely difficult to raise money in these circumstances.

We will have more on this later on in which we can share more thoughts about this development, but as a lifelong Wake Forest fan it just feels like the program has completely abandoned winning as a goal of the program.

https://www.tarheelblog.com/2019/4/18/18456838/unc-basketball-schedules-trio-of-official-visits-recruiting-2019-keeling-pierce-harris-tar-heels,"By now you’ve probably seen the news. In a flurry of recruiting activity, UNC has scheduled official visits with a trio of players for next week. With a massive void on the perimeter, all three players would help fill the void left by Coby White, Kenny Williams, Cameron Johnson, and Nassir Little. We’ll give you a quick down and dirty on potential future Heels and how they could fit into next season. Akil will still cover football and basketball recruiting tomorrow in our weekly recap.

Christian Keeling
Shooting Guard, 6-4, 175
Charleston Southern (Graduate Transfer)

The shooting guard from the Big South has been a hot commodity. Currently ranked as ESPN’s #7 overall transfer on the market, Keeling would bring a scoring and rebounding threat on the wing. He averaged 18.7 points and 6.9 rebounds last season, but has been an impact player since he arrived in Charleston. For his career, Keeling has averaged 17.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.1 assists.

He has averaged a respectable 35% from beyond the arc over three seasons, but that is buoyed by a career-best 38% success rate last year. Averaging 6.3 three-point attempts as a junior, Keeling isn’t afraid to let it fly. With 4.8 free throw attempts per game, he also isn’t afraid to attack the rim. How those skills transfer to tougher competition is still an unknown, but judging by the amount of interest he’s generated, most coaching staffs aren’t too concerned. Over 25 schools reached out in pursuit of his services.

Keeling will officially visit UNC from April 23-25. He has already visited Georgia Tech and is headed to Clemson this weekend. You can find additional details in this article by Inside Carolina’s Sherrell McMillan.

Justin Pierce
Small Forward, 6-7, 215
William and Mary (Graduate Transfer)

Pierce is listed as the #5 overall transfer by ESPN, which may surprise some fans. As a junior he “only” averaged 14.9 points on his way to 3rd-team All-CAA honors. His value, however, comes in his versatility. Pierce also averaged 8.9 rebounds and 4.1 assists, and can play multiple positions on the perimeter or high post. That kind of flexibility could benefit UNC next season.

A career 34.5% success rate behind the arc, like Keeling, is respectable. Unlike Keeling, Pierce saw a significant dip in his long-distance shooting success. As a sophomore he hit 41.6% on 3.6 three-point attempts per game. Last season, his shooting dropped to 32.4% while his attempts increased to 4.9 per game. Obviously UNC would hope for a repeat of his sophomore numbers, but his rebounding success is likely more attractive to the Tar Heel coaching staff."
http://play.nirsa.net/2019/04/13/saturday-520pm-game-results/,"The 5:20pm games were characterized by two words: hard-fought and decisive. There were four Unified quarterfinal games, one Men’s Intramural quarterfinal game, and two Women’s Club Round of 16 games.

In the Unified Division playoffs, the Oregon Ducks faced the Iowa Hawkeyes in what was a close match that came down to the wire. At the half, Oregon led 17 – 13 and they maintained control throughout. With less than 2 minutes left in the game, there was only a 2 point difference. After a battle of free throws, the Ducks pulled a 38 – 29 win over Iowa. Athlete, Ken Ward, scored 6 points alongside partner, Mason Lockwood who scored 7 points, had 3 rebounds, and 1 assist.

Oregon and Iowa weren’t the only ones with a nail-biter. The University of Toledo and Colorado State University took their Unified Playoff game to overtime. Colorado State made a crucial go ahead lay-up and scored again that brought their lead to 4. After a made free throw and a drive inside, the University of Toledo made it a 1 point game with 38.5 seconds left in overtime. Ultimately, Colorado State hung on for the victory 39 – 37 in a hard-fought win. Davey Mathis with Colorado State had 7 points, 2 rebounds, 1 assist, and 2 steals.

The Men’s Intramural Playoff also ended in a dramatic finish with SFA – The Takeover besting SRSU Lobo Nation 55 – 53. SRSU led SFA going into the second half 31 – 29, but ultimately couldn’t hang on for the win. Tyler Zivney for SFA had 16 points and 1 steal to lead his team to victory.

The Raptors trailed 61-60 midway through the third, then went on a 16-0 run over the next four minutes to take the lead for good. The Raptors were led by Pascal Siakim's 30 points and 11 rebounds.

It marked Isaac's first home playoff game of his career. He had 14 points, seven rebounds, an assist, two steals and two blocks in 29 minutes of action. He was 4-for-11 (36.4%) from the floor and 2-for-7 (28.6%) from the perimeter. He made all four of his free throw attempts.

The Magic now trail 2-1 in the series.

Game 4 of the series between the Magic and Raptors will be played on Sunday at 7 p.m. It will be broadcast by TNT.

The next NBA Playoff action for a former Seminole is when Malik Beasley and the Denver Nuggets face the San Antonio Spurs in Game 4 of their series at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening. That game, which will be played at San Antonio, will be shown on TNT. The Spurs have a 2-1 advantage in that series."
https://blog.drdishbasketball.com/20-mistakes-of-basketball-training,"When basketball training, you likely know the cliche sayings: Work hard. Push yourself. Love the grind. Etc. Etc. 

Many of these sayings are valid and useful, but too many players don't exactly know how to apply these statements effectively when they train.

While there are many hard workers out there, there are still many pet peeves of mine when it comes to basketball training. Admittedly, I committed many of these myself when I was a player. Now I cringe every time I see these mistakes from players today. 

These mistakes are also committed many times during the season and in practice! Often times, basketball coaches are just as culpable as their players.

Avoid these mistakes and ALWAYS train with a purpose behind everything you do. That is what we we're all about at Dr. Dish Basketball - whether you're training with our machines or not!

Thankfully, Dr. Dish machines with our NEW Skill Builder addresses many of these mistakes head-on! For pricing information, fill out this form.

1. Not having a goal 
The best players know exactly what their goal is when they get to the gym. Whether it's getting up 500 shots, 200 makes, or 15 minutes of purposeful ball-handling, great players have a goal before they go to work.

2. Not having a plan 
Much like having a goal, always have a plan when you get into the gym. What are you specifically going to work on to get better today? Be able to answer that question before starting your workout. Always train with purpose. 

3. No accountability
Whether it's having a coach, parent, teammate, or even yourself keep you accountable, it's essential to push yourself to hit your goals and stick by your word. If you committed to making 500 shots a day and you only made 200 yesterday, you better make 800 today. That's the mindset that separates good from great.

4. Not being coachable
Never think you know everything. Listen to your coach and implement the suggestions he/she gives. I can't stand players that don't want to be coached or think they are smarter than their coach."

http://www.womenssportsinformation.com/blog.html,"Hidey ho Stanford Women’s Basketball fans. Just a quick blog to tell you that the Stanford Women’s Basketball team, ranked 11th just beat the number 3 ranked team, Baylor.

Yes, the score will show a final of 68-63, however it was more of a beat down than that. Stanford was up 41-25 at the half. Yes, you read the right.

Baylor has two bigs, 6-7 Kalani Brown and also very tall Lauren Cox. What if we told you they held Lauren to TWO total points, and Kalani Brown to five? Lauren and Kalani each had two in the first half!

I will say this, give Tara VanDerveer enough time, in this case about two weeks, to prepare for a team, and she will figure out how to beat them with lesser players (no offense, Stanford starting five!). She will key on your two best players, Brown and Cox, and make you beat them with your third or fourth option. This disruption to the super stars who are used to scoring is usually hard for teams to handle, as Baylor witnessed this game. Baylor did get a nice game out of NaLyssa Smith and Chloe Jackson, each with 15 points, but it was not enough.

Then came Coffee

We have to give major props to Senior Shannon Coffee, for my home town of Dayton, Ohio!! She has been a bench player and was called on this afternoon to guard Kalani Brown, due to her 6’5 size. And she did a good job on the the afore mentioned five points of Brown. However Shannon is not known for her offense. However again, she made three 3-pointers, chipping in nine points to the cause. They were especially timely in the fourth, when Baylor mounted a comeback from that disastrous first half, and got within seven.

Tara-ism at its best:

""Shannon has been someone that has been a role player for our team and a lot of times she's led the cheers on the bench,"" VanDerveer said. ""Today people were cheering for her. She made some big shots. Her defense was really good. It was really exciting for her to have such a big game in a big game.""

Some fun facts:

Our two tallest players, Allan Smith (lead Stanford scorer with 21) and Shannon Coffee were 8-of-13 from deep.
Seven of Shannon’s 12 career 3-pointers have come against Baylor, including three this Saturday!
Baylor had more turnovers (15) than assists (13)
Brown had a season-low five points on 2-of-7 shooting
Some not so fun facts:

Stanford was 9-21 at the free throw line. Maybe with all that scheming, Tara forgets to have the team practice free throws?
Next up is Tennessee on Tuesday at ol’ Rocky top. See ya there (or on the SEC channel if you get it!)

Nov 11: Stanford Women’s Basketball beats Coach’s old team

This was a game of numbers. First, the Stanford Women’s Basketball team took on Idaho, for the third time in program history, but first time for Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. Why is that important? Idaho gave Tara her first head coaching job forty years ago and according to my trading card I got at the game, she was 42-14 in those two years.

Stanford won handily, 115-71, and no, the 115 is not an infamous misprint, Stanford really did break 100, the first time in two years, and fifth highest total since 1994, when they scored 122. And this was a three-ball affair.

Tara Vanderveer spoke after the game and said Idaho is known for hitting threes. Yes indeedy. They hit 15 of ‘em (way to go, Ida-ho!). That’s okay, Stanford hit 16 of ‘em, tying a program record. Idaho has two players that have over 300 made threes in their career. And Stanford actually stopped those two! It was the other two they didn’t know about."

Washington commits keep recruiting 5-star Jaden McDaniels, but he’s still ‘taking my time’

By Percy Allen 
Seattle Times staff reporter
TUALATIN, Ore. — Aside from an occasional inquiry, Isaiah Stewart and Marcus Tsohonis have stopped recruiting Jaden McDaniels on behalf of the Huskies.

But that doesn’t mean they’re not pulling for Washington to land the coveted five-star prospect from Federal Way.

“Quiet dude,” said Stewart, another five-star prospect who verbally committed to UW and plans to sign scholarship papers next week. “I don’t know what he’s going to do.

“If I had to guess, I would say Washington because I feel like it’s a great fit for him. But I don’t know what’s going on in his head or his mind or what his timetable is.”

Tsohonis, who signed with the Huskies last fall and played with McDaniels on the Seattle Rotary AAU team, will playfully ask him to throw up a “W” sign while posing for pictures.

“That’s my guy,” said Tsohonis, a 6-foot-5 combo guard who played at Jefferson High in Portland. “We talk a lot, but it’s more like a friendship and it’s not necessarily about basketball.

“But sometimes, I tell him little comments like ‘Bro, hurry up and commit to UW.’ And he laughs. Just little stuff like that.”

McDaniels isn’t bothered by the playful ribbing and understands it comes with the territory.

“It doesn’t really bother me that they try to recruit me and play around, but they mostly let me have my own space,” he said. “I respect them for doing that.”

With less than a week remaining before the start of the spring signing period (April 17 to May 15), McDaniels isn’t in a hurry to conclude a recruitment that has left spectators guessing.

The highly touted 6-11 phenom who is projected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft, took official visits last fall to all five of his finalists — Washington, San Diego State, Kentucky, UCLA and Texas.

McDaniels’ recruitment has been described as mysterious because he’d rather talk about anything other than his college choice. Adding to the ambiguity is the dearth of information coming from his tight-knit circle of advisers that includes his parents and brother Jalen, who played at San Diego State.

“I’m my own person,” said McDaniels, who is one of just seven among the top 50 prospects, according to ESPN, that remains undecided on their college future. “I think differently. People usually commit early and don’t usually wait as long as I am.

“I’m just taking it all in. Seeing if coaches get fired or if people are staying instead of rushing it so I can make the right choice.”

Last week UCLA hired Mick Cronin, a move McDaniels said didn’t “help or hurt” the Bruins’ chances to land his services.

McDaniels offered no clues as to when he’ll make announce his decision. He’s more focused on improving his game while playing in the Jordan Brand Classic, the Iverson Classic and the BallisLife All-American Game.

“I’m really just taking my time and finding the right school,” McDaniels said. “It’s a big deal because that’s where you going to spend the rest of your … however long you’re there. I just feel like I’m going to take my time and when I feel like the time is right that’s when I’ll probably make my decision.”

On Thursday, Tsohonis shared the court at the Portland Trail Blazers practice facility with McDaniels.

Tsohonis and McDaniels played on a team comprised of Pacific Northwest standouts that scrimmaged against Stewart and Team USA ahead of the Nike Hoop Summit.

McDaniels, who averaged 23.2 points, 10.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.1 steals last season at Federal Way, displayed the versatile skill set that’s drawn favorable comparisons to Kevin Durant.

During one sequence, McDaniels squared off against Stewart on the perimeter and rose over the 6-9, 248-pound forward for a 20-foot jumper.

“He’s an all-around versatile KD-type of player,” Stewart said. “He’s a beast. Straight up. … I hope we play together next year.

“That would be dope. We’d definitely have Washington turned up for sure.”

https://www.btpowerhouse.com/2019/4/19/18411205/wisconsin-basketball-big-ten-search-of-future-playmakers-2019-2020,"After the Wisconsin Badger season ended in a disappointing loss to Oregon in the NCAA Tournament, the Badgers will look to improve next season. The Badgers will also have to overcome the loss of two key seniors in Ethan Happ and Khalil Iverson.

Recently named the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award winner, Ethan Happ will prove to be a huge loss for the Badgers. As the only player in the country to average more than 15 points, 10 rebound and four assists, along with two triple doubles, Ethan Happ has been a playmaker at Wisconsin since players like Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker left.

The athletically gifted Khalil Iverson will also be greatly missed in the Wisconsin program. Iverson seemed to find his confidence late in his Badger career, but it is no doubt a wish of Badger fans to keep him for one more year.

The question for Greg Gard’s continuously growing team is, who is the next great Badger playmaker? The Badgers have many options for this role that could have been suppressed the last couple of seasons due to the overbearing presence of Happ.

The first option for the Badgers is redshirt Junior D’mitrik Trice. After returning from injury during the 2017-2018 season, Trice proved his ability to knock down clutch shots from the three-point line and the free throw line. He was the second leading scorer for the Badgers and will most likely be looked upon as the go-to playmaker for next year’s Badger team.

Continuing with guard play, incoming junior Brad Davison will look to take more reps for this Badger team during the upcoming season as well. Davison was the stand out freshman for the Badgers after both Trice and Kobe King went down with injuries during the 2017-2018 season. During his second year, Davison was known more as a defensive presence, but will look to combine his first two seasons for another stand out season to come.

Another guard support could come from senior Brevin Pritzl who put up good numbers for the Badgers late in last year’s season.

While both Happ and Iverson provided some height for Wisconsin, the Badgers will need to find another big man to score next season as well. Wisconsin has the options of Nate Reuvers, Kobe King and Aleem Ford at their disposal.

Reuvers was thrown into his freshman year due to injury and while Wisconsin was able to find some offensive support from him, he needed more preparation. Reuvers put on 35 pounds of muscle over the off season and came back as more of a threat for the Badgers in 2019. The Badgers will look for him to continue to develop as he will most likely take the reps down low in-place of Happ.

King and Ford will potentially battle for the final stating spot depending of is Gard goes big or small in his lineup. Either way, Wisconsin will seek out more opportunities to work in both King and Ford’s shooting and driving abilities.

The Badges will also explore the option of acquiring the Hauser brothers via transfer from Marquette. Both Sam Hauser and Joey Hauser are Wisconsin natives and played high school ball with Badger Trevor Anderson. They would fit in nicely with the Badger’s in need of some size and versatility.

Final options for Wisconsin will come by Ohio State transfer Micah Potter, redshirt freshmen Joe Hedstrom and seven-footer Owen Hamilton.

https://www.dukebasketballreport.com/2019/4/19/18507245/mike-cragg-finds-his-man-mike-anderson-new-st-johns-coach,"Former Duke assistant A.D. Mike Cragg, now the head man at St. John’s, took some heat for the search to replace recently resigned Chris Mullin. Having whiffed on Bobby Hurley, Porter Moser and Tim Cluess, some people were starting to panic.

In fairness to Cragg and St. John’s, they never publicized their overtures. The search was conducted in a professional and reasonable manner. It’s not their fault that this turned into a spectacle.

It is to their credit that it ended Thursday night with former Arkansas coach Mike Anderson.

On the surface it may seem like an odd hire. It’s always a plus to have city ties in New York and Anderson, who was born in Birmingham, Alabama and coached at Tulsa and Arkansas as an assistant to Nolan Richardson before taking the Mizzou job and then returning to Arkansas, has few.

But he is a far better basketball coach than Mullin ever was and he does have an exciting, fast-paced style that should appeal to St. John’s fans and more importantly, to recruits.

It may take people a little while to get used to the hire but it’s relatively low risk and the potential is pretty high. He wasn’t as good at Arkansas as he was at Mizzou but he was damn good there.

His biggest challenge is to decide how local he wants to be. Like Memphis, you can recruit at St. John’s and never have to fly anywhere. Or he could cast a bigger net.

He’ll need to curry local ties and one suggestion by the New York Post is to hire former Duke walk-on Andy Borman, who works with the New York Rens, an AAU program, and who might be a great fit. He certainly knows the local scene and a guy like that could be indispensable.

But our guess is that almost no matter who he hires, the recruiting will be much easier at St. John’s than it was at sleepy Arkansas. It’s a basketball school in a still vital basketball Mecca and if he can find enough players - he starts with just seven - then it could be a great partnership for everyone.

Fantasy Basketball: James Harden – Fantasy MVP
March 31, 2019	| 2018 Fantasy Basketball, Fantasy Basketball Daily Notes	| 5 Comments
by: Joel

Not only was James Harden the only player to stay healthy for the entirety of the fantasy basketball playoffs, but he has also been putting up insane lines. Last night he went 7-50-11-10-0-0-3 on 13-of-31 shooting and 17-of-18 FTs. You must feel like a fool if you didn’t draft this man number one overall. He’s the clear cut top fantasy player, and he didn’t take any rest days in the crucial games of the fantasy season, unlike pretty much every other relevant player in the league. For most of us, today is the last day of the fantasy basketball season, and we are sad. Many of us have mentally moved on to fantasy baseball, but for one last day let’s reflect on the fantasy season that was, and enjoy one last day of fantasy basketball before the inevitability of the Warriors championship run commences. Here’s what went down last night in the NBA:

"
https://www.rumbleinthegarden.com/2019/4/19/18508134/mike-anderson-st-johns-red-storm-introduced-head-coach-talks-relationships-communication,"On this Good Friday, St. John’s announced former Arkansas head coach Mike Anderson as the 21st head coach of the men’s basketball team in a mid-afternoon presser. Confirmed as the hire yesterday, Anderson replaces Chris Mullin, who stepped down early last week.

Anderson, with his wife seated in the front row and some of the current St. John’s players in the back, was introduced by Athletic Director Mike Cragg and St. John’s President Conrado “Bobby” Gempesaw.

After the lead in from the President and the Athletic Director, Anderson talked, clearly new to New York, having first discussed the position two days ago. (He even called the now-Brooklyn Nets the “New Jersey Nets”.)

Anderson brought an excitement with him, talking on a range of topics while seated in front of the press:

He spoke of winning a championship as a player and vision to win a championship here in New York.
Anderson commended Chris Mullin and what he did for the program.
He talked about the progress of building the program and recruiting in a first-class manner. He pointed out that he likes to be able to speak to his players about more than basketball, building lifelong relationships on and off the court.
He said he is known for two things: “relationships and communication”.
Anderson seemed excited about the talent on the roster, noting a few times that last year’s team won 21 games.
As far as the team on the court, he told fans that the team will be entertaining, will score, will defend, and play fast. “You gonna see St. John’s basketball phew [ed. note: think of the sound effect of the Warner Bros. Roadrunner] — fast. Y’all like to play fast? Let’s get it on.”
At one point during the press conference, Mike Anderson invited players Eli Wright, LJ Figueroa, and Mustapha Heron to the dias.

Anderson has not had a team meeting yet, but he did reach out to a few players. (According to Mustapha Heron, he called “early”, and Figueroa may not have been awake yet.) Anderson didn’t comment about players returning, but said they are here because they care — indicating that they are leaning towards staying and building with the new coach.

The Rumble spoke to Eli Wright after the press conference about his first thoughts Anderson’s hire."
https://www.testudotimes.com/maryland-terrapins-basketball-recruiting/2019/4/18/18485686/hakim-hart-2-star-shooting-guard-commits-philadelphia-mark-turgeon,"The Philadelphia native was originally a St. Joseph’s commit, but he reopened his recruitment after Phil Martelli was unceremoniously shown the door. Hart is an AAU teammate of fellow Philly native and Maryland commit Donta Scott and visited campus last weekend.

A shooting guard from Philadelphia’s vaunted Roman Catholic program, Hart is fresh off leading his team to a second straight Catholic League title. The 6’6 guard’s ranking belies his impact, as he was named first team all-state by USA Today on Tuesday after averaging 21.1 points per game his senior season to lead Roman Catholic in scoring.

Hart’s commitment fills the scholarship left open by Trace Ramsey’s transfer Wednesday and a need for a shooter in the class. Hart joins Scott, as well as twin bigs Makhi and Makhel Mitchell. As a two-star, his commitment moves the needle on the class ranking just a bit, pushing Maryland past DePaul and Syracuse to No. 27 in the nation.

The Terps had been after four-star shooting guard Lester Quinones for much of the cycle, but both sides appeared to have moved on in recent weeks. Hart might not be the final addition, as Maryland could end up with another open scholarship before the end of the offseason. Bruno Fernando and Anthony Cowan Jr. declared for the draft Monday, and while Cowan is expected to return, most expect Fernando to keep his name in the draft.

Maryland has not officially received Hart’s National Letter of Intent, but with the regular signing period for basketball opening Wednesday, his pledge should be official before long."

UConn-Louisville women’s rematch in Albany is possible as NCAA bracket released
By Pete Dougherty, Staff writer on March 18, 2019 at 6:35 PM

A potential rematch between 11-time national champion Connecticut and Louisville could materialize Sunday, March 31, in Albany, if the seeds hold for the NCAA Women’s Basketball Championship.

The brackets were released Monday, and, as expected, Connecticut (31-2) was placed in the Albany region, but surprising as a No. 2 seed, behind Louisville (29-3), which beat the Huskies 78-69 Jan. 31 in Louisville.

If the favorites win, the four teams playing the regional semifinal Friday, March 29, at Times Union Center would be Louisville, UConn, No. 3 Maryland (28-4) and No. 4 Oregon State (24-7). All are in the top 11 of Associated Press top 25 poll released Monday.

Other teams bracketed in the Albany region are 5-Gonzaga, 6-UCLA, 7-Rutgers, 8-Michigan, 9-Kansas State, 10-Buffalo, 11-Tennessee, 12-Ark.-Little Rock, 13-Boise State, 14-Radford, 15-Towson and 16-Robert Morris.

Teams will need to win first- and second-round games this weekend to make the four-team field in Albany.

The regional semifinals will be played at 7 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Starting time for the championship game has not been determined."

However, the Blue Devils still won the ACC Tournament Championship, finished the regular season ranked as the No. 1 team in the country, captivated a nation, and finished with a 32-6 record.

The most prestigious award of the night, the team MVP Award, was maybe the most obvious, but the Blue Devils went with Co-MVP’s this season in R.J. Barrett and Zion Williamson.

Barrett was named as the USA Today Player of the Year and a consensus First Team All-American, averaging 22.6 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game.

R.J. Barrett also won the Iron Duke Award for the most minutes played in a single season. Barrett played in every game for the Blue Devils, averaging 35.3 minutes per game, totaling 1,341 minutes in 38 games.

Williamson won just about every other National Player of the Year Award, including the Naismith Award, the Wooden Award, the AP Player of the Year, the ACC Freshman and Player of the Year, and was also a consensus First Team All-American. Zion averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 2.1 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game.

Zion Williamson was also awarded the Best Field Goal Percentage and Best Rebounding Average Awards. Williamson led the team shooting an unbelievable 68.0% from the field and also led the squad with those 8.9 rebounds per game.

As expected, Zion Williamson and R.J. Barrett declared for the 2019 NBA Draft in Ju"

The Wildcats dominated the Cowboys 85-46 and held OSU to its lowest score this season.

Without a chance for a comeback, Mike Boynton, the Cowboys’ coach, used the end of the game as an opportunity to give his new walk-ons experience.

Dee Mitchell, a freshman guard from Jefferson, Texas, entered the game with 9:07 left and played until the end. He hit a pair of free throws for his first points as a Cowboy.

Gabe Simpson and Tanner Taylor joined the lineup with 2:57 left. Cade Wagner and J.K. Hadlock rounded out the all-walk-on group.

Hadlock, the newest walk-on, played his first game for OSU. He made a jump shot with 14 seconds left.

OSU (10-17 overall, 3-11 Big 12) had 12 bench points, eight of which scholarship player Curtis Jones contributed.

Many basketball fans and reporters expected this outcome. Kansas State defeated OSU 75-57 in Gallagher-Iba Arena, and the loss was predictably worse in front of Bramlage Coliseum’s purple-clad crowd. There aren’t many positive takeaways for OSU, but that doesn’t mean the Cowboys didn’t try to play with toughness.

No. 23 Kansas State is the top team in the Big 12. Before Big 12 play started, Boynton picked the Wildcats to win the conference.

It’s difficult for any team, especially a squad with seven available scholarship players, to overcome Kansas State (21-6, 11-3).

In the final minutes, Boynton made a wise decision when he chose to give the walk-ons more time to play. If a loss is unavoidable, it’s a good move to let the bench guys have more experience and give his other players time to rest. It’s an interesting situation for players who earned this opportunity because of an open walk-on tryout.

Luke Major, the only walk-on who has been on the team since the season started, didn’t play. The O’Colly doesn’t have information about why he didn’t. Major played four minutes when the Cowboys lost to the Wildcats in Stillwater.

Wildcats limit offensive effectiveness of Dziagwa, fellow captains

Thomas Dziagwa didn’t match the career high again.

In the Cowboys’ loss to Texas on Feb. 16, Dziagwa had a career-high 23 points. He tied that score in OSU’s victory against TCU on Monday.

Kansas State held Dziagwa to eight points. He went 2-for-9 from 3-point range and knocked down two free throws.

Lindy Waters III and Cameron McGriff, his fellow captains, each had two points. McGriff and Waters haven’t both scored in double digits since the Cowboys’ home loss to Texas Tech on Feb. 13, though Waters had 14 points in the victory against TCU.

It doesn’t take in-depth analysis to show why this happened. The Wildcats are good, and the Cowboys’ captains have little time to rest this season.

Freshmen led OSU’s offense. Yor Anei had a team-high 12 points, and Isaac Likekele followed with 10. This is a reassuring point for the Cowboys. If Anei and Likekele continue to improve, OSU could become a different team when the next recruiting class arrives."

Our player recap series ends with the last remaining player to have played minutes in the 2016 National Championship game."
http://mightyray.blogspot.com/,"Pashcal Chukwu wrapped up his career with the Orange this past season.  He never developed an offensive game other than offensive rebounds and alley-oop dunks, but he did get somewhat proficient with those making 72.1% of his shots his senior year.


Paschal Chukwu
Chukwu did not make too many of Syracuse's to 100 lists, but he did chart some places.

355 career points is nowhere near the top 100 for Syracuse.  Including his time at Providence, Chukwu scored 445 career points, or less points than Elijah Hughes scored this past season.

458 rebounds for 54th all-time.  Jeremy McNeil has 460 and Adrian Autry 456.

163 blocked shots for 12th all-time.  He is well behind #11 Conrad McRae (163) and just ahead of Baye Moussa Keita (154).

53 steals for 83rd all-time.  He is similar to Matt Roe (54) and Sean Kerins (52).

Oshae Brissett - By the Numbers - 2019
Oshae Brissett ended his freshman year on a high note, leaving fans with high expectations for 2018-2019.  Unfortunately, Brissett did not improve over the summer, and appeared to regress in many ways, particularly with his three point shooting and free throws.  

Here are the numbers for Brissett's developing career:


Oshae Brissett
976 points scored for #64 all-time at Syracuse.  He is currently right behind teammate Frank Howard (992 points).  If Brissett does return for his junior season, he will most certainly be the 63rd Syracuse player to score 1,000 points in his career.

581 rebounds for 37th all-time.  Preston Shumpert had 589, Lawrence Moten 590.

95 assists for 90th all-time.  He's in the same company as Andre Hawkins (96) and Sonny Spera (90).

85 three point field goals made for 31st all-time.  Teammate Elijah Hughes has 87 for his career , and Malachi Richardson had 79.

56 blocked shots for 39th all-time.  That is similar to Donte Green (57), Kueth Duany (57) and Jerami Grant (55).

https://www.swishappeal.com/wnba/2019/4/19/18507227/wnba-draft-analysis-atlanta-dream-maite-cazorla-li-yueru-marie-gulich,"Maite Cazorla is the lone rookie draft pick eligible to play for the Dream in 2019. As a player who never came off the bench in her career at Oregon, Cazorla’s college experience is massive compared to many other rookies. Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports
After a second-place finish in 2018, the Atlanta Dream’s latest acquisitions — or lack thereof — suggest the team is looking for experience to propel them to a similar position once more.

An active draft night saw Atlanta select Brianna Turner as the 11th overall pick. But by the end of the night, it had traded Turner to Phoenix for center Marie Gülich. The team’s third-round pick was Chinese center Li Yueru, who won’t be eligible to play until 2020.

Thus, the Dream ended up with just one potential rookie for the 2019 WNBA season in Oregon guard Maite Cazorla, who came off the board 23rd overall. But Atlanta also signed undrafted Tennessee guard Meme Jackson to a training camp contract on Wednesday, making eight guards in the running to make the roster.

Atlanta isn’t an older team, by any means, with just three players in their 30s. But they’re still top-heavy, age-wise, and that makes it more difficult for younger players to grab starting jobs. Fourth-year center Imani McGee-Stafford received two starts last season, while third-year guard Brittney Sykes started seven games. Meanwhile, the team’s major starters average about seven-and-a-half years of WNBA experience apiece, ranging from Elizabeth Williams’ four to Renee Montgomery’s 10.

Will it be an uphill climb for Atlanta’s newest players to make the squad? Yes. But as shown by Monique Billings in her rookie 2018 season, averaging 11 minutes in 32 games, playing time doesn’t have to be hard to come by once a player establishes herself."

A former four-star prospect, Hunter was expected to be a big part of the Hoosiers’ success this past year, and although you can’t blame injuries for a team’s lack of success, his inability to play played a large role in Indiana’s struggles.

As a senior, Hunter averaged 20.2 points and 10.2 rebounds per game while finishing his career scoring 1,314 career points and grabbing 729 rebounds.

Announcing, officially, in January that he would redshirt the season, it continues to be a slow road to recovery, but it does seem that Hunter continues to progress and may be ready to play come November.

Winning the gold jersey in practice before his injury, which coach Archie Miller gives out to the most outstanding player in practice each week, Hunter was one of the best players on the court for the Hoosiers."
https://evobball.com/claire-1000/,"Claire Miller, senior forward for Flint Hill High School, is now a part of the 1,000 point club! Claire has been training at Evolution for the last two years with Doug Howard and has been a varsity starter all 4 years of high school. Crazy enough, Doug is an alum of Flint Hill High School. Over the last two years training with Doug, she has really improved her ball handling and her finishing near the rim with both hands. This improvement can be accredited to her impressive work ethic as Doug says she has never once had a bad workout where he felt the need to tell her to go faster or harder. Doug also said, “ She comes in to each workout with an enthusiasm to get better and always has a smile on her face when in the gym.  This carries into her games where her tenacity is noticeable as she is either crashing the boards or running the court to get a fast break layup! Her combination of having a high motor and high skill level sets her apart.”
 
All of her hard work is paying off! Doug was fortunate enough to be in attendance when she scored her 1,000th point and said, “It was a great moment not only for me to witness her achieving an incredible milestone, but also for Claire and her family for all the time, effort, and commitment they have spent to get to that point. Seeing her accomplish it at home and the school that I attended as well was a cool moment”. After Claire graduates this year, she will be headed off to Middlebury College to continue her academic and athletic career.

https://www.nunesmagician.com/2019/4/19/18508028/begrudgingly-virginia-championship-shows-just-how-dominant-acc-has-been-conference-acc-syracuse,"No, we’re not claiming Virginia’s national title as some sort of victory for Syracuse. There will be no “A-C-C” chants to echo the SEC’s embarrassing practice that lets Vanderbilt feel like they had something to do with what Alabama football and Kentucky basketball did.

That said, it’s worth looking at what the ACC — which we’ve been members of since July 2013 — has done in the postseason these past 10 years. Some of that success has involved the Orange and some hasn’t. But with or without Virginia’s championship last week, it’s still an impressive run of postseason success.

David Teel wrote about the men’s basketball side of things for the Virginian-Pilot, pointing out the conference’s staggering amount of NCAA Tournament success since 2010. The ACC’s won four championships (Virginia, North Carolina, Duke twice) and has seen six Final Four trips from four different programs — one of those being the Orange. Teel cites the 74-35 NCAA Tournament record as another stunning stat. That also ladders up to a record number of credits paid out to the league in that timeframe. And that’s just men’s basketball.

In the same stretch, the ACC’s won three football titles and participated in all five College Football Playoffs to-date. One women’s basketball team (Notre Dame) has won it all this decade, but an ACC team has been in the title game five times. Other sports have taken home a total of 31 national championships since 2010 (27 if you get rid of Maryland’s four while still a member of the league).

All of this is a long way of saying that the ACC’s really rounded into form in recent years, and right on time with Syracuse’s arrival (give us as much credit for that as you deem fit). We’ll see what the next decade brings. But the recent run of success certainly sets us up nicely as the conference network is set to launch later this year.

That, plus the rest of your Syracuse-related links below:

Virginia’s title puts an exclamation point on ACC’s decade of postseason dominance (The Virginian-Pilot)

Virginia just punctuated 10 years (2010-19) of ACC postseason dominance that saw league teams go 109-58 in the NCAA tournament. The only other decade in which a conference won at least 105 NCAA tournament games: 1990-99, when ACC programs went 105-48. ACC teams went 15-6 in this season’s NCAA and are 74-35 since 2015, a .679 winning percentage over five seasons.

Yet both schools refuse to get over themselves, convinced somehow that they needn’t offer anything more than the privilege of wearing their gear to lure coaches and players to their campuses.

How is former four-star recruit Qadir White developing? (Syracuse.com)

Challenging moments like this have dotted White’s first year on campus. One of a handful of Dino Babers recruits to receive a four-star rating by a major recruiting service, he’s spent the last nine months largely out of the public eye. But he’s been busy -- switching positions and enrolling in the school of Slayton, logging extra hours in an effort to learn the playbook and gradually transforming his body to become more agile and conditioned.

Ex-Syracuse assistant Tammi Reiss named URI women’s basketball coach (Providence Journal)

“From the first time I spoke with Tammi, I knew she was special. Her experience and success as a player at the highest levels of college and professional basketball are certainly terrific,” Bjorn said. “What makes her even more special is the approach she takes in working with young women. I know she will be able to teach them the game of basketball, but she also will teach them leadership, accountability, teamwork and a commitment to excellence.”

But one of the reasons the whole thing worked so well was the exceptional effort of the cornerbacks, led by Fredrick. One year after a disastrous secondary upended Syracuse’s season, the unit was among the most improved in college football. And Fredrick proved to be a valuable leader, allowing fewer than 50 percent completions and just 6.8 yards per attempt when serving as the primary defender.

http://orange44.blogspot.com/,"Syracuse has played Baylor twice in the past, and have beaten them twice. Syracuse will take on the highlighter clad team from Texas in Salt Lake City in the First Round of the NCAAs. In a pretty interesting 8/9 matchup, Syracuse will look to advance to take on 1 Seed Gonzaga. This is obviously going to be the battle of the zones, with Baylor imploring a 1-3-1, and you know how SU is rolling. So obviously the team that has better Zone offense will win the game. Baylor is a tough rebounding team, but Syracuse is a taller team, so this could be an fairly even matchup on the boards. Baylor is lead by transfer Makai Mason, who averages 14.6ppg. He's had a nagging injury, but has come on strong the last couple of weeks again. If Syracuse can contain him, and really gain a rebounding advantage, Syracuse should be able to pull away in the 2nd half. Especially if any of the shooters for Syracuse get in rhythm. This game on paper will be close, but I actually think that Syracuse will have the defensive advantage with their length, but also should shoot the ball over the zone better. If Syracuse can box out, they should hold Baylor at bay. Either way, with or without Frank Howard, I'm taking the Orange in this game by eight. This game is available nation wide on TruTV / March Madness On Demand at approximately 9:57pm*. Both John and I will be watching. It's March, which means now the real games begin. LET'S GO ORANGE!"

You can easily schedule yourself into a tough situation.’’

In each of the last two years, a well-designed non-conference schedule has helped Syracuse earn an at-large bid into the NCAA tournament.

In 2018, Syracuse played non-conference games against Kansas, Maryland, Connecticut, Georgetown, Buffalo and St. Bonaventure. That schedule, plus wins over Maryland, UConn, Georgetown and Buffalo, made up for Syracuse’s 8-10 ACC record.

This past season, Syracuse’s non-conference schedule, which included games against Oregon, UConn, Ohio State and Buffalo, wound up ranked 35th in the country. Even though Syracuse lost three of those four games, plus another one to Old Dominion, the Orange benefitted from playing a tough schedule.

“We didn’t have a great non-conference record,’’ Wellman said, “but we had a great non-conference strength of schedule.’’

The ACC’s expanded schedule reduces the number of non-conference games from 13 to 11. Syracuse already knows it will play two games in the NIT Season Tip-Off at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The potential opponents are Oklahoma State, Ole Miss and Penn State."

Roberson, who began the year in Greece, will play with the Agua Caliente Clippers. The G-League franchise owned Roberson’s rights since he was under contract with the club last year. Roberson, 24, played well in the G-League last year, averaging 10.2 points, 7 rebounds and 21.4 minutes per game. He played in 19 games in Greece this season, averaging 5.9 points and 3.8 rebounds. This is Roberson’s second season as a professional basketball player."
http://ottosgrove.com/lets-talk-about-low-post-scoring-and-syracuse-hoops/,"Hey gang. It’s been awhile, at least in terms of updating anything on the website. If you follow me on Twitter, you know that if anything, I’m probably still tweeting too much, but just haven’t gotten around to adding any new content. Well, I figured it was time to talk about what I think is a bit of a fallacy with regard to the need to traditional low post scorers in today’s game.

As with most things that I get rant-y about, this started on Twitter after I’d finally gotten around to watching some clips of Jesse Edwards, the 6-foot-11 center prospect that Syracuse recently offered out of the Netherlands, by way of IMG Academy.

(Sidenote… let’s hope that the individual from IMG Academy who was named in yesterday’s total shitstorm involving bribes and college admissions fraudulence has nothing to do with Edwards or any of the football players out of IMG currently on our roster.)

Anyway, back to the topic at hand. I was watching Edwards and the first thing that really stood out to me was that he’s not remotely a “traditional” center prospect. He’s not a back to the basket, low post scorer. He’s long, lanky, and has a tremendous amount of skill for a player his size. He can handle and he’s got a nice looking stroke on his jumper, but no one is ever going to confuse him for a dominant inside presence. With the way he moves and plays, along with his build, he reminds me a bit of Chris McCullough, but less explosive athletically.

It was my first time watching him play, and I can see why Syracuse’s coaching staff likes his potential. There’s plenty of it, that’s undeniable. He’s a very low risk, high reward type of prospect, along the same lines as Marek Dolezaj and Robert Braswell.

And that started a little bit of back and forth with some folks on Twitter who believe you need a back to the basket center, or at least someone a little more traditional in that role. Frankly, I disagree. Looking back at some of the recent national champions, how many have had a real “traditional” center that was pivotal (no pun intended) to the team’s success? Duke had Jahlil Okafor when they won the title in 2015, but of the last five champs, he’s really the only traditional back to the basket volume scorer in the mix.

The game has been trending away from the “traditional” center (think Shaq, or Patrick Ewing – if you can stomach it – for example) for a long time, and has been evolving into more of a positionless style. Last year the top two picks in the NBA Draft – DeAndre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III – were center prospects, but are a far cry from being “traditional” in that they are both face up scorers.

Looking at the 2019 recruiting class, even the top big men in the nation are hardly traditional. James Wiseman is probably the closest, but when I saw play on the EYBL circuit he scored as much facing up as he did with his back to the bucket. Vernon Carey is a power forward with a perimeter game, and obviously, Isaiah Stewart isn’t actually a center prospect despite being perhaps the most “traditional” low post player in this year’s class."
https://sujuiceonline.com/2019/04/19/what-will-it-take-for-syracuse-basketball-to-improve-next-season/,"The last three seasons, the Syracuse men’s basketball team has been stuck in mud of mediocrity.

Let’s put aside wins, losses and NCAA Tournament runs, and look at the team’s adjusted efficiency margin (AdjEM). This is a tempo-free metric of how many more points per 100 possessions the offense will score than the defense gives up, adjusted by the strength of opponents. For year-over-year comparisons of how ‘good’ a college basketball team is, this is one of the best measures.

From 2017 through 2019, Syracuse’s AdjEM has gone from 13.4 to 14.8 to 15.2 this past season. None of those are the worst in the last 20 years – not even in the bottom four. But it is the worst three-year run in the last two decades that KenPom has recorded data.

The problem is that Syracuse hasn’t improved. The team has stagnated.

The best year-over-year improvement in AdjEM came in 2002-2003, when Syracuse won the National Championship. The special sauce that season isn’t hard to figure out: Carmelo Anthony.

But the next two best one-season turnarounds are perhaps a bit more surprising. In 2008-2009, Jonny Flynn led a team with only one senior to an 8-point AdjEM improvement. To put that in perspective, had this past year’s team had an 8-point higher AdjEM it would have finished on the level of Virginia Tech or Florida State.

The next best single-season improvement was 5.8 AdjEM in 2015-2016. The year prior to that w"
http://orangefizz.net/2019/04/the-acc-is-anyones-conference-in-2019-20/,"Last year was one of the more entertaining years in recent memory for the ACC. It all culminated with a heart-stopping run by the Virginia Cavaliers to cut down the nets.

But there’s a lot of change that’s going to take place between the final buzzer in Minneapolis and when the season tips off next fall. A lot of talent is being flushed out of the conference, which could open up the ACC race for next year.

Per usual, a number of ACC players are headed to the draft. But this crop is particularly special. Duke is set to lose its three best players in Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish. Virginia will do the same with Ty Jerome, Deandre Hunter and Kyle Guy declaring, albeit Guy leaving the door open for a return to school. UNC may be the team hurting the most from departures. They are preparing for life without Cam Johnson, Kenny Williams, Luke Maye, Nassir Little and Coby White.
While this hasn’t been an issue for these teams in the past, they also don’t have the benefit of their usual elite level recruiting classes inbound. Only three of 247 Sports’ top 30 players are headed to ACC schools at the moment. For context, the conference has had three guys rank 15th or better every year since 2014. Some of this could change since the recruiting cycle is not over yet. Regardless, there still won’t be as much talent as we saw coming in for the 2018-19 season.

As of now, Louisville is the only ACC team with a top 10 recruiting class, according to 247 Sports. Traditional power UNC currently sits at 50th in the rankings and most of the conference sits sandwiched in between. Only three 5-star recruits are officially coming into the conference. Duke alone brought in four 5-stars last season.

All seven ACC teams that reached the tournament last year could lose their best player. Six of them are locks. The one hanging in the balance at the moment is Louisville with Jordan Nwora leaving the door open to return. Some teams are in better shape than others. As I mentioned, Chris Mack is getting his first full recruiting cycle in with the Cardinals. Other teams are experiencing complete overhaul, like Virginia Tech. The Hokies hired former Wofford head coach Mike Young after Buzz Williams left for Texas A&M. In the process, VT lost three players to graduation and one to the draft. But they also lost a number of key parts who are deciding to transfer. At least four players have already entered thei"

Fischer Chosen As Region Coach Of The Year
UW-Oshkosh's Brad Fischer has been selected as the NCAA Division III Central Region Coach of the Year by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA).

Fischer and the seven other regional Coaches of the Year are now finalists for the WBCA Division III Coach of the Year.

The other seven coaches to garner Coach of the Year honors were Bob Amsberry from Wartburg College (Iowa) in the West Region, Michelle Filander from Austin College (Texas) in the South, Jeff Hans from Thomas More University (Ky.) in the Great Lakes, Mike Miller from Messiah College (Pa.) in the Middle Atlantic, Fred Richter from DeSales University (Pa.) in the Atlantic, James Seward from State University of New York at New Paltz in the East, and Adrienne Shibles from Bowdoin College (Maine) in the Northeast.

Fischer led UW-Oshkosh to the WIAC outright regular season and postseason titles this season before advancing to the third round of the Division III Championship. The Titans finished atop the league standings and won the WIAC Championship in the same season for the second time and first since the conference tournament debuted in 1999.

Fischer helped a program-record five Titans achieve All-WIAC honors this season as UW-Oshkosh won the league title by two games. UW-Oshkosh went into the NCAA postseason ranked 13th in the nation by D3hoops.com. The Titans have been among the top 25 teams in the D3hoops.com poll during 74 of the past 80 weekly polls.

Fischer's 2018-19 team posted a 26-4 record and won the NCAA Division III Championship Oshkosh Regional title. The Titans won their WIAC-leading 13th regular season title led the WIAC in scoring defense (49.1), average scoring (+17.4) and rebounding (+6.4) margins, field goal percentage (.431), turnovers per game (12.7) and assist-to-turnover ratio (1.16). The Titans' scoring defense and turnovers per game ranked ninth and 10th, respectively, in the country.

Fischer, who sports a 165-37 record in his seven years at UW-Oshkosh, has guided the Titans to the NCAA Division III Championship five of the past six seasons. UW-Oshkosh also advanced to the third round of the national tournament in 2014 and 2017, and to the second round in both 2015 and 2016.

Fischer previously earned 2014 Central Region Coach of the Year honors from D3hoops.com as well as WIAC Coach of the Year plaudits in 2013, 2017 and 2019. Fischer helped UW-Oshkosh win the 2017 and 2019 WIAC regular season titles in addition to league tournament championships in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2019.

Fischer has led UW-Oshkosh to at least 20 victories during each of his seven seasons, marking the second time in conference history that a program has won 20 or more games in at least seven consecutive years. His 165 wins ranks 11th on the WIAC's all-time coaching list while his .817 winning percentage is third best among conference coaches with at least 70 wins."

McMillan finished the year as the top scorer in the ODAC at 18.5 points per game. He was also fifth in the league in rebounds per game (8.9). While shooting a career-best 46.7 percent (175-of-375) from the field and a career-high 37.1 percent (53-of-143) from beyond the arc, he registered at least 20 points 10 times this campaign, highlighted by a season-high 33 points in an 85-75 victory at William Peace on November 11.

McMillan eclipsed 1,000 career points this year in a 75-63 win at Eastern Mennonite and is 17th on W&L's all-time scoring list with 1,236 points. He is also fourth in program history in made three-pointers (151) and seventh all-time in blocks (80). He had 28 blocks this season, which was seventh in the conference.

This is McMillan's first time being selected to one of the D3hoops.com all-region teams. He is just the third player in program history to receive the honor. Greg Bienemann '08 made the third team in 2008 and Clayton Murtha '18 secured a spot on the third team last season. McMillan also garnered First Team All-ODAC accolades earlier this year.

The Generals finished the season 19-8 overall, falling in the semifinals of the ODAC Tournament to Randolph-Macon. The 19 victories were the most for the Blue and White since the 1988-89 team went 20-7, and marked just the 10th time in program history W&L won at least 19 games in a season."

Head Assistant Coach Ty Edwards will assume the role of interim head coach moving forward.

""We are very grateful for Sam's presence over the past eight years,"" said Rackley. ""Not only has Sam showed he can produce positive results on the court, but he has also established himself as a great mentor and leader of young men. It's been a pleasure to work with him, we thank him for everything he's done for us and wish him the absolute best in the future.""

In eight seasons as the Scots' head coach, Hargraves amassed a record of 85-124. His tenure is highlighted by a trip to the NCAA Division III Elite Eight in 2015-16, where the Scots finished the season ranked sixth in the nation by D3hoops.com. Alma won a school record 24 games that year, placed second in the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association with a 12-2 record, and won the league's postseason tournament for the first time in program history, earning a bid to the NCAA Division III National Tournament. There, Alma topped a pair of top-10 teams – No. 5 John Carroll and No. 7 St. Norbert – before falling to national finalist and No. 2-ranked Benedictine. Following the 2015-16 campaign, Hargraves was named the Great Lakes District Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches and the Men's College Coach of the Year by the Basketball Coaches Association of Michigan, and received the Glenn Van Wieren Coach of the Year award from the Champions of Character organization.

In the season prior, Alma recorded 12 victories, the most wins the program had seen since the 1996-97 campaign. The Scots also posted a 9-5 mark in MIAA to finish fourth and qualify for the MIAA Tournament for the first time since 1997. The league record was the best at Alma since the 1977-78 season. The Scots also defeated Calvin for the first time since 1998-99, and Hope for the first time since 1997-98 last season.

Several players have thrived under Hargraves system. In 2012, Tom Erickson and Cory Schneider were both named All-MIAA Second Team and Schneider graduated as the school-record holder for most three-point field goals made in a season with 70 – DJ Beckman broke the record with 75 in the 2015-16 season. Isiah Law, 2014 graduate, set the single-game three-point field goals made mark with eight. Fellow 2014 graduate Brandon Krause finished his career as one of the most consistent players in the history of the program, leaving Alma tied for second on the games played list with 100 while his 239 career assists are sixth most in school history. Krause was a two-time All-MIAA Second Team selection (2013-14). In 2014-15, Alma had two players earn All-MIAA honors. Scott Nikodemski, a first-team selection, led the league in assists and steals, while DJ Beckman received second-team honors. In 2015-16, Scott Nikodemski was named the MIAA's Most Valuable Player and became Alma College's first-ever All-American, earning First-Team honors, while DJ Beckman and Trevor Gernaat were named to the All-MIAA Second Team.

Hargraves, a native of Alanson, Mich., played and graduated from Calvin College after a stellar career at Alanson High School.

While at Calvin, Hargraves played three years of varsity basketball, and as a senior, was named to the All-MIAA Second Team (1998). In his final campaign, he led the league in three-point field goals made with 71, good for ninth in Calvin College history. He ended his career as one of the top three-point shooters at the school, ranking eighth in career three-pointers made with 143 and 12th in three-point field goal percentage at 40.2 percent (143-356).

Lawton was the SSC Player of the Year, the D2CCA South Region Player of the Year, an NABC all-Amerian and first-team all-district selection, and one of 25 finalists for the Bevo Francis Award as the top non-Division I men's basketball player in the country.

A second-team all-district selection a year ago, Lawton has been selected to play in the Reese's Division II All-Star Game on March 29 at the Ford Center in Evansville, IN, the site of this year's Division II Elite Eight."

The lead: The final week of the 2018-19 basketball season started with a trip to Emory & Henry for the first of two Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) road games. Hollins would look to avenge an earlier loss to the Wasps, but a slow start would lead to a long night for the Green and Gold.

The result: E&H 73-46

How it happened: Emory & Henry would use defense to seize control of the rematch from the opening tip. The Wasps would turn Hollins over seven times and hold the visitors to just 25% shooting (2-8) as E&H raced out to a 24-5 first quarter advantage. Hollins would rebound to take the second frame but still faced an 18 point deficit at the break. Emory & Henry would shoot 44% from the field and use 18 Hollins turnovers to pull away for the ODAC win. 

Hollins notes: 

Forward Keyazia Taylor would add six blocked shots to her ODAC leading total (57) while enjoying her 15th double-digit rebound game of the season
Kayla Surles led the Hollins offense with 16 points and assisted on five of the team's other 12 field goals
With three more made three pointers, Keenan Surles took over the team lead, in ODAC play, with 35 
Emory & Henry notes:

14 different Wasps scored on the night
Sydney McKinney led Emory & Henry with 13 while Tessa Johnston added 11
E&H scored 27 points on Hollins 18 turnovers
What's next: Hollins will wrap up the regular season on Saturday when they travel to Eastern Mennonite for a 2:00pm tip with the Royals.
