Baseball fans welcome Opening Day each year. Why? Well, it isn’t complicated. Fans love the game. The opening day of a new season holds promise every time. Colorado Rockies fans have weathered their team’s ups and downs and still sigh dreamily over 2007. Hey, it could happen again, right?
Today, Opening Day for the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field in Denver, a balmy 70 degrees is forecast. The game may draw huge crowds and complicate the traffic grid, but here’s what you need to know about navigating the bustle.
Also, a sunny day out of the office calls for refreshment extraordinaire. Some foods just taste better in a stadium or on a patio. Here are some dining options near Coors Field.
Balloons flurry up on Opening Day, Coors Field, April 1995.

"When Christian Ziegler got the assignment to design a new stadium for Jersey City, he planned a voyage with Parks and Public Buildings Commissioner Arthur Potterton for a reconnaissance trip to Rochester, Cleveland, Montreal, Boston, and Philadelphia, according to the New York Times.
On June 5, 1929, Mayor Frank Hague made the announcement about the city getting a new stadium with a capacity to host 50,000 people. The Times reported, “Work can start in three months, it is expected, and the stadium should be finished by the Spring of 1930.”
It took a bit longer, as is the tradition with construction projects.
On December 10, 1935, groundbreaking began at the site, adjoining Newark Bay, and which formerly housed Jersey City Airport; the Jersey Observer noted, in particular, Hague’s positive proclamation after making the initial dig: “This is a great day for Jersey City. You must realize that all the money needed for the construction of the stadium was donated by the government. The city merely furnished the ground and pays the architect’s fees.
“This stadium has been the dream of the Jersey City officials for a number of years.”
Hague, a politician who exerted the right amount of pressure on the levers, switches, and buttons of Jersey City’s political machinery to get things accomplished, often colored outside the lines of the law to get things done.
Less than a year and a half later, the dream became reality—named for President Franklin Roosevelt, under whose aegis the Works Progress Administration governed the construction, Roosevelt Stadium débuted on April 23, 1937; the Jersey City Giants occupied home team status in the International League contest, losing a 12-inning game to the Rochester Red Wings. Final score: 4-3. In attendance were New Jersey luminaries, including Jersey City Hague and Senator A. Harry Moore, who was a former governor.
Future Dodgers skipper Walter Alston banged the pitching of Giants hurler Rollie Stiles like a southerner swats flies on a humid night in August—the Red Wings first baseman went four-for-five and drove in two runs, including the game winner.
Roosevelt Stadium’s architecture affected the crowd. “All who attended yesterday’s imbroglio gasped at the layout which Mayor Hague and the W. P. A. have provided,” reported New York Herald Tribune scribe Stanley Woodward. “The grandstand and bleachers are of yellow fire-brick and a wall of the same substance surrounds the whole layout. The end seats of each row are emblazoned on the aisle side with cast-iron shields, painted with ferryboats and square-rigged ships and bearing the motto, ‘Let Jersey Prosper.'”
Nine years after it opened, Roosevelt Stadium became the site of history—on April 18, 1946, Jackie Robinson played his first professional baseball game. It was a 14-1 pounding of the Giants by Robinson and the Montreal Royals. Robinson turned in an impeccable performance at the plate:",http://davidkrell.com/tag/new-jersey/

"MILWAUKEE -- Enrique Hernández owns Madison Bumgarner. He homered three times in a pennant-clincher. He homered twice on Opening Day.

He’s no fluke. But it was still something of a shock on Friday night when he lined an 0-2 fastball from the intimidating Josh Hader for a three-run homer to give the Dodgers a 5-3 comeback victory over the Brewers and extend their win streak to six.

• Hader proves he's human after all

In the Major Leagues, Hernandez had never homered on an 0-2 pitch, and Hader had never allowed one. The Dodgers saw Hader’s act last postseason, saw how manager Craig Counsell utilizes that electric left arm at all different stages of the game. The Dodgers know Hader presents a menacing opposing weapon around which a game plan is drawn.

“You knew with Hader having three days off, they were going to deploy him for multiples [innings] and you don’t know when,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who also knows that 34 pitches should sideline Hader for Saturday night, and maybe Sunday.

Coming into the game, current Dodgers were 2-for-19 against Hader in the regular season, and they didn’t score off him last postseason. So, just what makes Hader, well, Hader?

“Analytics?” Hernandez said. “I don’t know -- extension, spin rate, whatever you want to call it. Drop, angle, bouncy. It gets there quick. He does a really good job of hiding it. He’s got an unorthodox windup, kind of. He’s aggressive, his hair is flowing everywhere. It always seems like his fastball is a tick higher than you think it is. It was all about matching the plane and keeping the swing short.”",https://www.mlb.com/news/enrique-hernandez-homer-lifts-dodgers-over-brewers

All right, you surely knew this was coming. Tim Anderson is mostly notable because he's a plus-fielding shortstop who thus far in 2019 is slashing .422/.439/.656, which suffice it to say is outstanding production. Anderson's still just 25, and his potential development at the plate is certainly something to watch this year, as it has much bearing on the White Sox's long-term outlook. 

Anderson, however, is also a part of this episode of the Star Power Index because of this: ",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-star-power-index-will-we-ever-see-vintage-chris-sale-why-tim-andersons-home-run-sparked-a-heated-debate/
"MIAMI -- The Miami Marlins' runs came home on an error, a walk and a hit batsman, helping them break a four-game losing streak by beating the Washington Nationals 3-2 Friday.

Miami, last in the majors in runs, totaled just six hits and went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position. But pinch-hitter Martin Prado's bases-loaded walk in the sixth put the Marlins ahead for the first time since Saturday, and they won after being shut out in the past two games.

Caleb Smith (2-0) struck out eight and allowed one run in six innings. He won his second start in a row and lowered his ERA to 2.35.

Three relievers completed a six-hitter. Sergio Romo pitched a perfect ninth for his second save, and his first since March 31 as Miami (5-15) won a series opener for the first time.

Anibal Sanchez (0-2) allowed three runs in 5 1/3 innings.

Washington's Anthony Rendon doubled to extend his hitting streak to 17 games, longest in the majors this year. Teammate Brian Dozier hit his second homer.

The Marlins took the lead in the sixth inning, and they had help. With the score 1-all and runners at second and third, Sanchez fielded Rosell Herrera's bunt and threw home while the runners held, which loaded the bases.

Sanchez walked Prado on a 3-1 pitch to make the score 2-1. Reliever Matt Grace's first pitch hit Curtis Granderson in the hip, bringing in another run.

The Marlins ended a streak of 24 consecutive scoreless innings when they broke through in the second, and again they had help. An error by first baseman Ryan Zimmerman allowed a runner to come home from third.

Washington scratched out a run in the first. Adam Eaton led off with a bunt single, took second on a wild pitch and came home on Juan Soto's single.

In other moves Friday, the Red Sox announced they're calling up infielders Michael Chavis and Tzu-Wei Lin and have designed for assignment right-hander Erasmo Ramirez.

Chavis and Lin arrive for a three-game series against the Rays in Tampa that starts Friday, a day after the team announced that it had placed veteran second baseman Dustin Pedroia on the injured list with irritation in his surgically repaired left knee.

Infielder Brock Holt (scratched cornea), who the team had hoped would come off the injured list this weekend, reported not seeing well in a game Wednesday at Triple-A Pawtucket and isn't be ready. Blake Swihart, who was capable of playing second base in a pinch, was designated for assignment earlier in the week.

Things were so bad early this week that catcher Christian Vazquez, who played 4 2/3 innings at second base for Single-A Greenville in 2010, was forced to play the position Monday with a borrowed infielder's glove.

"They rent the game for a few years. They rent their places in it. Then their uniforms go back on the pile, their lockers named for somebody else. Much as they try to convince you -- or, really, themselves -- otherwise, there is no such thing as immortality. There is, at best, some old friends, a few beers and a regular pension check.

All those inches they won along the way, the ones they believed put people in their places, that championed the right way to play, that settled imaginary scores and punished artificial offenses, they go back on the pile, too. The next generation doesn’t benefit from those inches. Rather it is burdened by them, these musty and self-important acts of intimidation and vengeance that are, in reality, only childish and temporary.

Where it ends is with a fistful of jersey and a hollered, bug-eyed threat, young men and old men gaining and losing an inch of turf and superiority that won’t last, that can’t be defended, that isn’t worth the effort or the consequences of it. And then they have the audacity to say you don’t get it.

I mean, when did we start caring so much about the other guy? What he’s doing? What he’s saying? How he’s conducting himself? Who he answers to?

“Let the kids play” has become an anthem for the next baseball generation, a glorious idea in the macro that in the micro will earn a behind-the-neck fastball. So your kids are playful. Theirs are disrespectful. Your kids are expressing joy born of the game, of the neighborhood, of the culture. Theirs need to learn a little lesson in decorum.

There’s no winning that.

And Tim Anderson, the .422-hitting, 25-year-old shortstop for the Chicago White Sox who heaved a bat responsible for a home run, will sit for a game, not because he heaved a bat, but because he defended himself for doing it. Major League Baseball is not the culprit here. The rest of the kids are. The Kansas City Royals, who helped raise this generation before turning on it, which is so roaringly hypocritical but another topic entirely, came en masse for their inch of ground. Anderson called one of the Royals, who is white, the N-word coupled with other modifiers, because, well, who knows, except nobody’s allowed to back up.

"Aroldis Chapman was nicknamed the Cuban Missile for a reason. The Yankees’ lanky left-handed closer from the Caribbean island has long been the most prominent face of the velocity explosion in modern baseball. Ever since he broke into the major leagues in 2010, few pitchers could match his 100-miles-per-hour fastball.

Until last season. A month on the injured list with left knee tendinitis sapped some power, and his average fastball speed dipped slightly from the previous season, to 98.9 m.p.h. He was still among the hardest throwers in baseball, but for the first time since 2013, Chapman was not tops: St. Louis Cardinals relief pitcher Jordan Hicks, nine years younger, claimed the title with a 100.5-m.p.h. average, according to Fangraphs.

“That’s no problem for me,” Chapman, 31, said in Spanish recently, adding later: “I’m not 20 or 22 anymore. The years pile up — not by choice.”

So some eyebrows, including those of the injured and inconsistent Yankees, were understandably raised when Chapman began this season — albeit in the early April chill of the Northeast — throwing fastballs as slow as 92 m.p.h. It was yet another potentially worrying issue for a Yankees bullpen that has not lived up to lofty expectations, and for the depleted roster in general.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/sports/yankees-aroldis-chapman-velocity.html

"Mookie Betts: trade chip? Such is the terrifying universe posited by Red Sox lefty David Price amid his team’s brutal 6–13 start to the season. “If we don’t start playing better, J.D. Martinez, Mookie Betts, maybe myself, we could get traded,” Price told the Boston Globe’s Alex Speier following Boston’s series loss to the Yankees. “We’re what, 30th in minor league systems? We’re dead last. We don’t play better, Mookie Betts will be traded, J.D. Martinez will be traded. It will be tough for a while here.”

How serious Price is about this apocalyptic vision is unclear, but the doom and gloom is warranted. The Red Sox have the third-worst record and second-worst run differential (-42) in the majors, better only than the Marlins, and trail the first-place Rays by eight games in the AL East. Per FanGraphs, their playoff odds are down to a mere 50.7%, and their division chances look completely shot at 15.1%.


Things on the farm are indeed pretty dire.

"DENVER — Charlie Blackmon hit a two-out, two-run home run in the 12th inning, and the Colorado Rockies beat Philadelphia 4-3 on Friday night in a game that saw two Phillies players leave early due to injuries.

Bryce Harper hit a two-out, RBI double in the top of the 12th — his fifth hit of the night — off Chad Bettis (1-2) to put the Phillies on top by a run.

Juan Nicasio (0-1) issued a one-out walk to Tony Wolters but Blackmon then drove his 1-2 pitch into the visitors' bullpen beyond the center-field fence for his second career game-ending home run. It was the Rockies' sixth straight win over the Phillies dating to last season. Blackmon was swarmed by his teammates as he crossed home plate.

BOX SCORE: ROCKIES 4, PHILLIES 3, 12 INNINGS

The Phillies lost shortstop Scott Kingery midway through the fourth after he suffered a strained right hamstring while legging out his inning-ending fielder's choice. Andrew McCutchen, aboard with a walk, left in the top of the sixth after advancing to second base on Phil Gosselin's single with what the team later said was inflammation in his left knee.

The Phillies stranded 19 runners in the game, including leaving the bases loaded three times.

The Rockies were down 2-0 and struggling to get their bats going against Vince Velasquez, who had a season-high eight strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings, before Story got them on the board with a 459-foot homer onto the concourse behind the left-field bleachers.

Ian Desmond hit a two-out double — he was initially ruled out but a replay review showed Desmond slid inside second baseman Cesar Hernandez's tag — and Garrett Hampson followed with a broken-bat RBI double to even the score and chase Velasquez.

Colorado starter German Marquez, coming off his first career shutout last Sunday at San Francisco, labored through five innings. He gave up Rhys Hoskins' RBI single in the first and J.T. Realmuto's sacrifice fly in the fifth.

"An Opening Day note from Jewish Baseball News
March 28, 2019
By Scott Barancik, editor

It’s Opening Day of the 2019 Major League Baseball season, and Jewish Baseball News wants to welcome you to what we hope will be another great year for Members of the Tribe.

One key change you’ll notice at JBN this season is the frequency of posts. In past years, Ron Kaplan of Kaplan’s Korner has blessed us with Daily Pitch, a daily summary of MLB highlights. Unfortunately, a new job has made it impossible for Ron to continue with these posts, as he explains here. So for the foreseeable future, JBN will be posting weekly MLB summaries, much like we do with our popular Minor League Monday series.

On the bright side, we’ll continue to post frequent video highlights and other updates on our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, so be sure to follow those. And you’ll still be able to track daily Major League stats via the Jewish Box Score shown on our home page.

And now, a few additional notes:

It appears nine Jewish players will be on Opening Day rosters — including Rowdy Tellez, a last-minute addition by the Blue Jays. They include:
Richard Bleier (P), Baltimore Orioles – DL
Ryan Braun (RF/LF), Milwaukee Brewers
Alex Bregman (3B), Houston Astros
Max Fried (P), Atlanta Braves
Ian Kinsler (2B), San Diego Padres
Joc Pederson (CF), Los Angeles Dodgers
Kevin Pillar (CF), Toronto Blue Jays
Robert Stock (P), San Diego Padres
Rowdy Tellez (1B), Toronto Blue Jays
P Dean Kremer, a joint Israeli-American citizen ranked No. 9 on MLB.com’s list of top Orioles prospects, is the subject of this recent article by MLB.com’s Jonathan Mayo. The article includes several short videos of Kremer discussing his pitching mechanics.
P Zack Weiss, a Twins prospect who recently obtained Israeli citizenship, was recently interviewed by Rabbi Jeremy Fine of The Great Rabbino website. Among other topics, Weiss discusses his vexing 2018 MLB debut and how he’s tried to learn from it.

"In the meantime, deGrom has been placed on the 10-day injured list (retroactive to April 16). The Mets expect deGrom to return in time for their series against the Brewers on April 26.

“His arm felt significantly better following treatment with our health and performance staff today,” general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said in a statement on Friday. “Even so, Jacob will be evaluated by our medical team in New York on Monday in the abundance of caution.”Callaway said Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz will remain on turn to pitch Sunday and Monday, respectively. Saturday’s starter in place of deGrom has not yet been announced.

DeGrom underwent Tommy John surgery on the same ailing right elbow in 2010. He suffered a setback in September 2016 – undergoing another surgery due to ulnar nerve damage in his right arm. At the time, former general manager Sandy Alderson described the nerve damage as, “not unusual after Tommy John surgery.”

Although fans should keep their emotions in check before results of the MRI are released, deGrom’s elbow soreness is, at the very least, concerning in the interim.

The reigning NL Cy Young winner has given up five home runs over his last two starts and has seen his ERA jump to 3.68. Following his last start against the Braves (three earned runs, five innings), deGrom was uneasy about his location.

“I'm not really throwing the ball where I want to right now,” deGrom said on Sunday. “I felt great my first two starts. I don't think it's something that's too far off.”",https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-jacob-degrom-elbow-mri-20190419-bejxa4doz5gf3l3izkpjdkc5dy-story.html
"JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (April 19, 2019) – ETSU matched Wofford nearly hit for hit Friday night at Thomas Stadium, but could not keep up scoring-wise as the Terriers defeated ETSU 10-4 to even the three-game series.

ETSU outhit the Terriers 16-15 on the day, but Wofford added five walks to help their production. Both teams stranded 11 runners on base.

For the first time in two seasons, junior pitcher Landon Knack (Johnson City) was tagged with a loss with seven runs allowed over four innings. Prior to the outing, Knack (8-1) had won an impressive 21 straight decisions — 13 at Walters State Community College and eight at ETSU.

Despite allowing 12 hits and only striking out two, Wofford’s Austin Higginbotham (8-2) limited the Bucs to three runs (two earned) in seven innings of work for the win.

ETSU was led by its 3-4 hitters as juniors Cullen Smith (Lebanon) and Jackson Greer (Knoxville) each collected three hits. Smith hit a solo homer as ETSU was down to its last out in the ninth inning.

Wofford took an early 6-2 lead in the first two frames, including a four run second inning. Trailing 7-2 in the bottom of the fourth, ETSU had a late rally going that saw an RBI double from Jake Lyle (Spring Hill) bring new life. ETSU stranded two in scoring position, leaving the tying run on deck to kill the rally.

Wofford went on to add two more runs in the fifth and one in the seventh, while ETSU’s final run came on Smith’s ninth inning homer — his sixth of the season.

Saturday’s showdown will serve as the rubber match and is currently scheduled for Saturday, April 20 at 2 p.m. Follow us on our social media accounts below for updates.

"Next Up in Valpo Baseball: The Valparaiso University baseball team will step outside of Missouri Valley Conference play this weekend for a nonconference series at SIU Edwardsville leading into the Easter holiday. The two teams will play a single game on Friday before clashing in a scheduled doubleheader on Saturday.

Last Time Out: Valpo exploded for a season-high 11 runs including three home runs on a sunny day at Emory G. Bauer Field on Tuesday. Keegan Bates went six strong innings in his first career start and the Valpo pitching staff yielded just three hits in an 11-1 win over the Broncos that ended after seven innings due to the 10-run rule. Blake Billinger, Jeremy Drudge and Sam Shaikin all homered for Valpo, while Chase Dawson had three hits. There were several noteworthy occurrences in the Valpo victory.

The 11 runs marked the team’s season high. It was Valpo’s highest single-game run output since beating Dallas Baptist 13-10 in the first round of last year’s MVC Tournament.
Valpo pitching yielded just three hits, the fewest allowed by the team in a single game since May 10, 2015 when Ryan Fritze and Trevor Haas combined on a three-hit shutout of Youngstown State.
The three home runs were the most by a Valpo team since hitting four against those same Broncos last season in Kalamazoo.
On the Air: Live audio and stats for all three games of the series will be available courtesy of SIU Edwardsville Athletics. Links can be found on ValpoAthletics.com. In addition, follow @ValpoBaseball on Twitter for in-game updates.

Series Notes: This will mark the eighth meeting between these two teams with SIUe having won three of the first seven. Valpo prevailed 9-5 on March 20, 2011 in Edwardsville in the most recent matchup.

Double the Fun: When head coach Brian Schmack announced his team’s schedule in November, this weekend featured the only doubleheader on the slate as Valpo and SIU Edwardsville will play two on Saturday in order to enjoy Easter Sunday off. However, doubleheaders have become the norm rather than the exception for Valpo as this will mark the team’s eighth doubleheader of the year with the previous seven coming due to inclement weather that altered weekend series schedules. The team also opened the season with a set at Lipscomb that was shortened to two games due to rain, so the only series all year that has been the scheduled Friday-Saturday-Sunday was March 29-31 at DBU. The seemingly inordinate number of twinbills does have a recent precedent as Valpo played nine doubleheaders in 2017. However, the majority of those were scheduled due to a seven-team Horizon League double-round robin format where teams played five games against each league opponent.",http://www.valpoathletics.com/baseball/news/2018-19/19056/baseball-steps-outside-of-mvc-play-for-series-at-siue/

"CHICAGO – The University of Chicago baseball team captured both games of its first Midwest Conference North Division doubleheader, outgunning Lawrence University 10-8 in the first game before cruising to a 12-2 win in the second contest on Tuesday at Stagg Field.

The Maroons (13-4 record, 2-0 MWC North) rode double-digit run totals to victory as they racked up 27 hits across 15.1 innings of play. Although the visiting Vikings (3-14, 0-6 MWC North) rallied late in the first game with six runs in the final two innings, they could not muster a second comeback as UChicago pulled into a decisive 10-run lead to end the day early.

Senior left fielder Josh Parks set a blistering pace at the plate, going 7-for-8 with three RBI, three doubles and a home run. Sophomore shortstop Brian Lyle drove in a team-high seven runs, including five in the second game. First-year third baseman Carson Weekley also homered.

Powerful performances from UChicago's starting pitchers complemented the offensive output. First-year righthander Sam Bennett (3-0) struck out 11 of the 28 batters he faced while giving up five hits and two runs to earn the win in the first contest. His fellow first-year, southpaw Kyle Petri (4-0), fanned seven over five innings as the pitcher of record in the second victory, conceding just three hits and one run.

Game One – UChicago 10, Lawrence 8

Bennett was on target from the beginning, throwing 15 of his 17 pitches for strikes in the first inning. After junior right fielder Payton Jancsy drew a leadoff walk and stole second to begin the bottom half, Lyle poked a bunt single down the third base line that moved his teammate up another base. Jancsy then scored on a double-play ball to put the hosts on the board first.

The Vikings slashed two hits in the top of the third inning to get a runner in scoring position and brought him home on a sacrifice fly to even the score. In the bottom of the third, however, Weekley mashed a homer deep into the left-center field alley to make it 2-1. It was the rookie's third home run of the season.",https://athletics.uchicago.edu/sports/bsb/2018-19/releases/20190416wrypuv

"NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Looking to stay in the race for the Ohio Valley Conference regular season title, Belmont University Baseball plays host to Murray State University for a series this weekend. First pitch of the series is slated for 4:00 p.m. CT Thursday, April 17 at E.S. Rose Park. 

BATTLE AT THE TOP
This weekend's series will greatly affect the race for the OVC regular season title. Murray State enters the weekend tied with Jacksonville State for first place in the OVC with a conference record of 10-5.

"BERKELEY, Calif. - A Twitter user posed an interesting question last week: Is Andrew Vaughn the best college hitter ever? Considering all the great bats that have passed through college baseball over the decades, it's impossible to put that label on any single player, past or present. But the fact that Vaughn is right there in the discussion with any of the all-time greats is telling.

Few college hitters have ever shown the combination of elite power and elite hitting ability that Vaughn has demonstrated during his three-year college career at California. He hit .349/.414/.555 with 12 homers and 50 RBIs to earn freshman All-America honors in 2017. He hit .402/.531/.819 with 23 homers, 14 doubles, 63 RBIs to become just the Division I underclassman this century to win the Golden Spikes Award in 2018. That season, he had more than twice as many extra-base hits and walks (44) as strikeouts (18).

And Vaughn has kept on terrorizing opposing pitchers at a remarkable level as a junior this spring, hitting .344/.519/.708 with 10 homers and 30 RBIs, along with 31 walks and 20 strikeouts. Despite returning to campus as the reigning Golden Spikes Award winner and a slam-dunk top-10 (probably top-five) pick in the upcoming draft, Vaughn hasn't been fazed one iota by any external expectations or pressures.

""It's just a game, man. That's all I've got to play it as,"" Vaughn said. ""I just go out there every day, try to do my best, help my teammates win, and everything else takes care of itself. I mean, it is a great stage to be on, winning that Golden Spikes last year was unbelievable, but just gotta go out there and play the game. Can't think about trying to win it again, or try to go out and do better than I did last year - can't think that way, or you're not gonna do well.""

Vaughn is as even-keeled as athletes get. He said he hasn't gotten any extra attention walking around campus as the reigning national player of the year, but he likes it just fine that way. ""I just like to stay to myself and be a quiet guy,"" he said.

He's focused on playing for his teammates, on a mission to get Cal to the postseason for the first time since 2015.

""We talk about it all the time with all of our draft guys - 'Hey, just put the team first, do what you're supposed to do for the team and it'll all work out for the draft,' but it's a lot easier said than done,"" said second-year Cal coach Mike Neu. ""A lot of guys, it's tough, there's distractions, there's a lot of scouts, there's so many things that happen. But he just truly has lived that. He's just, 'Hey, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help the team win.' I think that's why it's working out for him. He has some distractions but it doesn't affect him. He just goes out and plays the same way every day.""",https://www.usabaseball.com/news/gsa-spotlight-andrew-vaughn/c-306157826/?tid=216639934
"ELKINS, W. Va. – Ohio Dominican's baseball team set a school and G-MAC record with 17 walks and tied a school-record with a 12-run inning as the Panthers closed the weekend with a 27-9 win over Davis & Elkins on Saturday. The Panthers had dropped the opener 7-4.

The 27 runs scored are just shy of the school record 30 which came in 1983 against Urbana. They're the fifth-most in a game by a Division II team this year, entering the weekend.

The 17 walks are also the fifth-most by a D-II team this year, while freshman Thomas Staab (Bellville, Ohio) tied a G-MAC record with five runs scored as he went 5-for-5 with three walks in the game while also swiping four bases.

With the game tied at 6-6 going to the fourth, ODU put it away by putting up the dozen runs, the most in an inning since the Panthers also had a 12 run inning against Capital in 2001.

The Panthers sent 16 hitters to the plate in that frame and scored 10 of the runs with two outs.

ODU also had five run frames in the first and fifth innings and would rack up 22 hits in the game.

In addition to Staab's huge day, senior Genesis Hillard (Cincinnati, Ohio) went 3-for-4 with five RBIs and four runs scored while junior Joey Machuga (Canfield, Ohio) and sophomore Tim Zeller (Mount Vernon, Ohio) also had four RBIs.

"It feels like yesterday that it was opening day, but time has passed quickly as we all soak in each game only itching for the next. There’s no doubt that for the majority, our fantasy teams need some turnover as guys slump and others just aren’t who we thought they were. In the big picture, it’s okay right now still as there is still a ridiculous number of games left and the waiver wire is still a treasure trove.

That treasure trove can be deep so to help sort through it to find some gems, we asked our featured experts below to identify which one’s are worth adding now that should be readily-available in your leagues as well. The following list of hitters and pitchers all have less than 20% consensus ownership.

Import your team to My Playbook for instant Waiver Wire advice >>

Q1. What one starting pitcher should fantasy owners look into picking up that is owned in 20% of leagues or less?

Ryan McMahon (1B/2B/3B – COL): 19% Owned
“McMahon came back from the IL on Thursday night, and immediately showed why he’s worth owning across all formats. He’s a power hitter that plays in Coors. His position flexibility means you should have plenty of opportunity to fit him into your lineups.”
– Tim Young (Brewer Rat)

“Ryan McMahon won’t be under 20% owned for long so I’d jump on that immediately. Yes, he struggled before being placed on the IL, but likely because he was playing virtually every game away from Coors. Now that he will be in Coors and batting near the middle of that Rockies order every day, he needs to be owned even in 8-team leagues, let alone 12 teamers. Think Corey Dickerson (while in Coors) but at second base, third base and first base.”",https://www.fantasypros.com/2019/04/8-under-the-radar-waiver-pickups-week-3/
"HANOVER, Ind. – The Franklin College baseball team looked for their first conference wins of the year on Tuesday (Apr. 2) afternoon with a pair of contests against the Hanover Panthers to wrap up a stretch of 10 straight games away from home.

The Grizzlies (12-8, 2-2 HCAC) fell behind early in both contests as the Panthers (8-9, 0-2 HCAC) jumped on Grizzly starting pitching in each game. But the Grizzlies would snatch victory from the hosts in both contests, rallying to sweep the twin bill by scores of 10-9 and 9-5.

Franklin smacked five home runs on the afternoon, with sophomore Jordan Crouse belting go-ahead two-run home runs in each game. Nick Wright, Ryan Bixler and Drew Naumovich all went deep for Franklin in game two as the Grizzlies extended their winning streak over Hanover to eight games.

Game One: Franklin 10 – Hanover 9
Franklin loaded the bases with no outs in the first and opened the scoring with a sac fly from Naumovich. But the Grizzlies would manage just the one run and Hanover would answer with three runs in each of their first two trips to the plate, opening up a 6-1 lead.

Naumovich drove in his second run of the game with a two-out single in the fifth, but Hanover brought in two runs in their half of the frame to take an 8-2 lead with half the game gone.

With time running out, the Franklin bats came to life in the sixth, grinding out six runs off Panther pitching. The Grizzlies opened the inning with three straight singles before Jacob Bryant brought in a run with a sac fly and Quenton Wellington followed with an RBI single to cut the lead to 8-4.",http://franklingrizzlies.com/sports/bsb/2018-19/releases/20190402um9nlp
"Starling Marte had to be carted off of the field on Friday after colliding with teammate Erik Gonzalez while converging on a fly ball.
It appeared that Marte's right knee collided with Gonzalez, who was running full speed into center field chasing the pop fly. He also may have taken a forearm to the throat. Marte will head for further evaluation. Look for the Pirates to provide an update on his status as soon as one becomes available.

Pete Alonso went 2-for-4 with a long solo homer, a walk, and two runs scored in Friday’s win over the Cardinals.
Yes, another missile. Alonso hit a homer in off Ryan Helsley in the sixth inning which traveled 432 feet to center field, with an exit velocity of 111.7 mph. He hit a single later in the game which actually checked in at 116 mph.

"By Andrew Battifarano / MiLB.com | April 19, 2019 10:42 PM

Considered one of the best all-around hitters in the 2018 Draft, Alec Bohm is quickly showing why his bat draws such high praise.

The top Phillies prospect matched a career high with three hits, reached base four times and scored twice Friday, but Class A Lakewood dropped a 5-3 decision to Lexington at FirstEnergy Park.

Gameday box score

Bohm started the campaign with three consecutive hitless games but has turned things around with six multi-hit efforts through his first 15 South Atlantic League contests. On Friday, MLB.com's No. 56 overall prospect raised his batting average to .333 and his OPS to .900. 

Facing No. 22 Royals prospect Austin Cox in the first inning, Bohm fell behind, 0-2, then laced a single the opposite way into right field. The Wichita State product found himself in another two-strike hole against Cox in the fourth but went back up the middle for another base knock. Three batters later, Bohm scored when Malvin Matos reached on an error.

In the sixth, for the third time of the night, Bohm got to two strikes but got the best of the left-handed Legends starter, lining another single to right. The Omaha native faced reliever Austin Lambright to lead off the eighth, working a five-pitch walk before scoring on a two-out hit from Matos.

Last year's third overall Draft pick started his professional career in the Gulf Coast League and moved on to Class A Short Season State College in the New York-Penn League. Landing on the disabled list in mid-July with a shin contusion, Bohm finished the year with a .252/.335/.324 slash line in 40 games.",https://www.milb.com/milb/news/blueclaws-bohm-puts-together-three-knock-night/c-306430928

"The Harvard baseball team (18-9, 8-4 Ivy) dropped a heartbreaker in the ninth inning to Massachusetts (11-18, 5-7 A10), 10-9, in the Beanpot Championship at Fenway Park Wednesday.

Harvard began the scoring in the first inning, thanks to senior Patrick McColl's home run, which curled around the right field pole. The Crimson added two more runs in the second inning, when first-year Logan Bravo mashed his second-career home run over Fenway Park's Green Monster in left field. 

Massachusetts answered in the bottom of the third, adding three runs on a couple extra-base hits to tie the game at three. 

In the fifth inning, Harvard put up four runs to regain the lead. The scoring began with junior Jake Suddleson reaching base on an error by the right fielder, scoring senior Ben Skinner from third. The bases would fill up for junior Chad Minato, who was hit by a pitch, scoring McColl. Senior Devan Peterson came on to pinch-hit and reached on a error by the second baseman, scoring Suddleson and junior Hunter Bigge.

Despite two runs in the bottom half of the inning by the Minutemen, the Crimson added a run the following inning when McColl singled up the middle, scoring Skinner. Bravo would get in on the action yet again, this time doubling off the Monster in the seventh inning, scoring Minato from second.

Harvard Highlights:

First-year Logan Bravo impressed with two hits and three RBIs, including a two-run home run over the left field wall.

" Russell Grant II, Keegan McCarville and Eric Lex combined on a four-hit shutout, and Andre Nnebe smashed a three-run homer to lead Santa Clara baseball to a 4-0 series-opening win over Gonzaga on Thursday.

Jake MacNichols and Tony Boetto each had two hits for the Broncos (8-27, 2-11 West Coast Conference), but it was Nnebe's blast in the eighth inning that provided the cushion to snap the team's four-game skid.

Grant II (2-3), a junior left-hander making his sixth start of the season, surrendered just three hits while striking out five and walking two Gonzaga (17-16, 10-6) batters in 6 2/3 innings.

McCarville yielded just one hit in 1 1/2 innings of relief and Lex didn't allow a hit in the ninth.

It appeared Dawson's Brigman's third-inning RBI single might be enough of offensive, but Gonzaga's Mason Wells walked two of the first three batters in the eighth to set the table for Nnebe who launched his third home run of the season over the left center field wall.

Wells (1-2) suffered the loss, surrendering all four runs on seven hits and four walks in his eight innings.

Gonzaga, which entered the series having won four of their last five games, had runners in scoring position in four of the last five innings, but never had one advance to third base in the game. The Bulldogs went 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position.

"COLUMBUS, Ohio – In front of an electric crowd of 5,280 fans at Nick Swisher Field at Bill Davis Stadium, the Ohio State baseball team claimed a series win over No. 24 Michigan Saturday with a doubleheader split vs. the Wolverines. The Buckeyes (20-17, 4-5 B1G) won game one, 10-4, while the Wolverines (24-11, 5-3 B1G) took game two of the twinbill, 6-2. The crowd on hand today was the second-largest at Bill Davis Stadium.

QUOTE FROM COACH
“We’re disappointed we didn’t win game three,” head coach Greg Beals said. “I thought we played really clean and really tough those first two games and we weren’t clean there in game three. We had some unearned runs and if we can eliminate those unearned runs, it would keep the game tighter and give us some more offensive options, but that wasn’t the case. At the end of the day, we won the series and we won the rivalry. The thing for me and the thing for our ball club to take away is how we went about it and the energy and focus we had. Our guys were locked in. They’re exhausted right now. Starting with the come from behind victory on the road and into this weekend, hopefully we learned a lot about ourselves and there’s a lot to build on.”",https://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ohio-state-claims-series-win-over-no-24-michigan-saturday/
"BALTIMORE – The Twins’ 2019 schedule was front-loaded with off days, just in case there were weather problems. Now that those off days are over, the bad weather has arrived.

A steady rain soaked Oriole Park at Camden Yards on Friday, forcing the Orioles to postpone tonight’s game with the Twins until Saturday. A traditional one-admission doubleheader will begin at 3:05 p.m. Central time, with the regularly scheduled game to follow.

The postponement makes Friday the seventh day without baseball in the 22-day-old 2019 season. The Twins were scheduled for an MLB-high five days off during the first two weeks, and have now lost two games to weather. A snowstorm in Minnesota prevented last Friday’s home game with the Tigers to be put off until May 11.

The Twins have not announced whether their pitching plans have changed for Saturday’s doubleheader. Jose Berrios was scheduled to start Friday’s game, with Martin Perez on the mound Saturday.",http://www.startribune.com/twins-game-rained-out-friday-in-baltimore/508816532/
"BALTIMORE – The last time Fernando Romero pitched in a major league game, it was to make an emergency start for a shorthanded staff last July, and he was immediately sent back to the minors.

Romero will be in a Twins uniform again on Saturday, but this time he knows ahead of time that it’s only a one-day cameo. Baseball rules allow teams to add a 26th player to the second-game roster when they play two games in one day, and the Twins chose Romero.

“He’s looked good, and with the situation we’re in right now, he fits really well,” manager Rocco Baldelli said. “He’s a guy that we think very highly of.”

Romero, who was converted to a relief pitcher this spring, has pitched four times for Class AAA Rochester this season, and allowed runs — albeit four of them, on three home runs — in only one. He threw two perfect innings in his last outing, Tuesday against Syracuse, and has struck out 11 batters in 8⅓ total innings.

“He’s made some nice adjustments,” said Baldelli, who expects Romero to be available “anywhere from a batter to two, three innings” in Saturday’s second game. “He’s throwing the ball well in some spurts, and we’re going to look to bottle him up.”

More disruption

Heavy rains were pounding Camden Yards around 3 p.m. Friday when the Orioles decided to postpone their game with the Twins. Within 20 minutes of that decision, the rains stopped and didn’t start again for quite a while. The scheduled 7 p.m. start time came and went with no precipitation; not until 9 p.m. did rain, much lighter than the afternoon’s deluge, resume falling.",http://www.startribune.com/twins-call-up-pitcher-fernando-romero-for-one-game-stint/508837182/

"After the game, Belt sounded off on the call and talked about holding umpires accountable.

“As big leaguers, we make adjustments,” Belt told reporters. “(Additon) has got to do the same thing. We put too much into this game to have at-bats taken away. Everybody out there is human. Everyone makes mistakes. But when you do it time and time again, something has to be done.

“It’s a game of centimeters, and when you’re off by an inch or two, to us, that’s not close. At no point was it a strike. I could see if it crosses the plate at one point, and I’m not sure those were the only two of the day. (Tyler) Austin, I know (Kevin) Pillar, he wasn’t happy. I hate to come out here and blame the whole game on that. We didn’t lose because of that, but you hate to see it taken away.

"SANTA CLARA — By the way he ended his 2018 season, you’d be surprised to know George Kittle played the final seven-plus games with fractured rib cartilage.

His teammates are, too.

In Week 9, Kittle suffered the injury, located right outside of his sternum, on the third play of San Francisco’s 34-3 win over the Oakland Raiders. He played through it for the remainder of the year without saying much of anything. The only way his teammates would have known about the injury is by noticing the two “giant” rib protectors he wore.

Joe Staley first heard about Kittle’s injury when a reporter filled him in on the deal Wednesday, as the team gathers for offseason workouts, which unofficially mark the start of the new season.

“George isn’t the type of guy to announce that he has something,” Staley said. “He’s a tough guy, so I don’t think he’s going to be out there telling everyone about tough he is.”

This means most of Kittle’s memorable plays and feats in 2018 were accomplished with the injury.

That includes his incredible one-handed snag, which he turned into a 71-yard gain, against the Raiders. Kittle admitted he thought the safety was going to “smoke” him over the middle.",http://www.knbr.com/2019/04/17/george-kittle-kept-rib-cartilage-fracture-a-secret-for-final-seven-games/

"The busy week continues for Nebraska (21-11, 10-2 Big Ten). The Huskers are right in the middle of a stretch that includes five games in six days.

After splitting mid-week matchups with Kansas State and Nebraska-Omaha, Nebraska is on the road for a weekend series with Iowa (21-14, 7-5 Big Ten). The Hawkeyes are one of the better teams in the Big Ten and will present plenty of challenges for Nebraska. That includes a little bit of history between the two programs.

“I don't know if it's a rivalry series because of football but both teams always bring it and it’s going to be a dog fight,” senior Angelo Altavilla said on Thursday.

Are Nebraska and Iowa rivals? If you’re looking for an answer, it won’t come from coach Darin Erstad. When he was an athlete at Nebraska, he approached every game the same.

“To be completely honest, I hated everybody,” Erstad said.

He also said he has no stance on the rivalry talk because he doesn't want any outside factors to affect how the Huskers go about their business.

“If we have to look for reasons to get up for a game, we’ve got problems,” Erstad said.

With that said, Nebraska is pretty happy with where they are in the Big Ten right now. The Huskers’ 10-2 record in conference play sits at the top of the Big Ten.

“You can’t ask for much better than 10-2,” Altavilla said. “I think we are right where we need to be right now.”

Nebraska is halfway through conference play and controls its own destiny. The schedule certainly doesn't get easier with conference matchups against Iowa, Illinois and Michigan, plus a non-conference matchup with Arizona State sandwiched in the middle.",https://hailvarsity.com/s/6729/rivalry-or-not-nebraska-ready-for-road-series-at-iowa

If that’s not enough joy to send you into your Friday night shenanigans, allow me to offer up one of the rarest feats of all: an Anthony Rizzo triple.

Having just 15 total career triples coming into today, and having recorded just one last year, it is a fun event whenever Rizzo hits one just right to net himself a three-bagger.",https://www.bleachernation.com/2019/04/19/friday-night-fun-anthony-rizzo-tripled-and-yes-thats-rare-video/

"CHICAGO – With temperatures in the low 40's and winds up to 25 miles per hour at Cougar Stadium in Chicago, Sacramento State (25-13, 11-3 WAC) beat the Chicago State Cougars (10-25, 5-9 WAC) in both ends of a Friday doubleheader.

Hornets slug three homers in eight-inning, 13-3 win

Despite the cold conditions, the Hornets came out swinging in game one of Friday's twin bill. Sacramento State scored 13 runs on 13 hits as they won their first 10-run game of the season, beating the Cougars in eight innings.

Eight of Sacramento State's hits in the opener went for extra bases, including three home runs.

Dylan McPhillips had the first long ball of the day, a solo shot in the top of the third inning. It was his second of the season and second in as many games, as the sophomore also homered in Wednesday's midweek game at Illinois State.

Ryan Walstad was next to leave the yard, hitting a three-run shot in top half of the seventh inning. The home run was also his second of the year.

Steven Moretto hit his fourth home run of the season, a two-run shot in the top of the eighth inning. Moretto's blast made it a 13-3 game, putting the Hornets ahead by 10 and bringing the WAC's 10-run rule into effect after Chicago State went down quietly in the bottom of the inning.

Although he didn't join in on the home run party, Martin Vincelli-Simard drove in a team-high four runs in the win. Vincelli-Simard was 2-for-5 in game one, including a bases-clearing, three-run double in the fifth inning.",http://www.hornetsports.com/sports/bsb/2018-19/releases/20190419uq4kco

The Tigers took game one, 12-2, before edging out the Terriers, 9-7, in the night cap.

Allowing just one run through the first four innings of game one, Hiram got themselves back into the game with a run in the top of the fifth.

Vince Suso led off the frame with a double, and was moved to third on a sacrifice bunt before Gavin Taulbee brought him home with a RBI single. Wittenberg would come back in the bottom of the fifth to re-take the lead, 2-1.

"CHICAGO – In acquiring Blake Swihart from the Boston Red Sox on Friday afternoon, the Diamondbacks added a catcher whom they don’t plan on using behind the plate – at least not right away, according to General Manager Mike Hazen.

To get Swihart, who was designated for assignment by the Red Sox earlier in the week, the Diamondbacks gave up outfield prospect Marcus Wilson. The Diamondbacks also received $500,000 in international bonus pool money.

The driving force behind the deal, Hazen said, was a belief in Swihart’s offensive upside and the sense that this could be the club’s only chance to land him.

“We really like his bat and think he has a chance to hit,” Hazen said. “If he ended up in a spot where he got to play every day and did what we felt like he could do with the bat, we wouldn’t have had a chance to acquire him.”

With the Diamondbacks, Swihart is not stepping into an everyday role, Hazen said, adding that he sees him bouncing between various positions other than the one he’s spent most of his career playing.Hazen said Swihart can play both corner outfield positions as well as first base and third base. He also mentioned second base as a possibility. Hazen said that, for now, the Diamondbacks feel they have the catching position covered, and he suggested that Swihart won’t displace any of the three catchers currently on the roster.

The Diamondbacks front office is familiar with him; Assistant GM Amiel Sawdaye was the Red Sox scouting director when the club drafted Swihart in the first round in 2011, and Hazen, manager Torey Lovullo and Assistant GM Jared Porter all crossed paths with him in Boston, as well.",https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/mlb/diamondbacks/2019/04/19/arizona-diamondbacks-trade-blake-swihart-boston-red-sox/3527002002/
"The St. Thomas Aquinas College baseball team settled for an East Coast Conference double-header split at Mercy College, winning the opener by a 4-1 count before dropping the finale, 5-2. The Spartans are now 16-21 overall and 8-11 in ECC play, with Mercy standing at 16-23-1, 8-11. With nine regular season games remaining, STAC is tied with Mercy in the conference standings, both 1.5 games behind Bridgeport for the fourth and final berth in the ECC Tournament.

Originally scheduled for Saturday, the twin-bill was moved to Mercy due to the forecast of inclement weather, setting the unusual stage of the Spartans playing as the ""home"" team in both games. STAC scored all the runs they would need in the second inning of the opener, as Anthony Maisano came across with the first run on a balk by Mavericks' starter James Jakuba. A throwing error allowed Tyler Patane to score, and James Versage came through with an RBI single to open a 3-0 lead.

TJ Gregory was strong from the outset and was touched for an unearned run in the top of the fifth as a fielding error opened the door for Miguel Ortiz Sanchez' run-scoring hit to draw within two. STAC got that run right back in the bottom half as Jared Vanderhoof led off with a double, was sacrificed to third, and scored on a Michael Morgan sac fly to score the game's final run.

Gregory gave up just the one unearned run on seven hits and six solid innings before giving way to Christian Allegretti, who slammed the door in allowing just one baserunner and no hits over the final three innings to earn his first save of the season. Tyler Patane turned in his second straight three-hit game to lead STAC.

Mercy took a 1-0 lead in the third inning of game two as Ortiz Sanchez drove in a run with a single, but the Spartans quickly jumped ahead with a pair in the bottom half. Back-to-back singles by Brian Donnelly and Angelo Baez set the table for a game-tying sacrifice fly by Versage. Baez scored as Vanderhoof reached on a fielder's choice as STAC jumped on top. Solo runs in the fourth and fifth put the Mavericks back on top, setting the stage for a turning point in the bottom of the fifth.",https://www.stacathletics.com/sports/bsb/2018-19/releases/bsb_at_Mercy-_4-19-19
"The Gamecocks’ offensive stat line is all over the map. On one hand, they lead the league with 59 home runs – a whopping 38 more long balls than the Aggies (21). That is an incredible difference and would initially lead you to believe that South Carolina has a huge advantage offensively. Not so fast my friend. The Gamecocks also have one of the lowest team batting averages at .241. That is 18 points below Texas A&M’s .259, which isn’t that great of a number either. TJ Hopkins leads the team in hitting with a .306 average, and three other starters are hitting between .272-.287. The remaining four hitters in the starting lineup are hitting just .235 or less. On the other hand, Jacob Olsen (.287) is among the league leaders with 12 home runs and a .605 slugging percentage, but he only has 29 RBI. Hopkins has hit nine long balls and leads the team with 33 RBI, and Luke Berryhill (.272) has eight homers to his credit with 33 RBI. That tells you a lot of their offensive run production comes from the home run.

After those three, the statistical numbers quickly fall off the table. When you combine the power numbers and the low batting averages, the results end up being pretty close to Texas A&M’s overall numbers. USC scores an average 5.86 runs per game, while the Aggies produce 5.92 runs per game. The Gamecocks have an on-base percentage of .339 compared to the Aggies’ .343. USC has walked 149 times compared to 150 for Texas A&M. And as you would expect from a power hitting team, South Carolina has struck out a whopping 341 times (9.21 k’s/gm). Given that Texas A&M’s pitching is second in the nation in strikeouts, expect to see a lot of Gamecocks going down swinging.

While it isn’t clear who has the upper-hand offensively, there’s no question that Texas A&M has the superior pitching staff. South Carolina’s team ERA of 4.57 is a full 1.68 runs per game higher than the Aggies’ 2.89 ERA. USC’s WHIP of 1.36 is much higher than Texas A&M’s 1.14. The Aggies have struck out nearly 100 more batters (433) than South Carolina’s pitching (334). Opposing teams are hitting .251 against Gamecock pitching compared to Texas A&M’s opposing batting average of just .222.


Tarah Cochran, TexAgs
The Aggies have a better starting pitching staff compared to South Carolina, beginning with John Doxakis on Thursday.
South Carolina’s Friday (Thursday) night starter is Reid Morgan with a 3-2 record and a 3.47 ERA, surrendering more hits than innings pitched. Solid collegiate pitching numbers, but not up to “Friday night” SEC standards. It’s certainly not up to John Doxakis’ 1.76 ERA. Game two’s starter will be freshman Cam Tringali who will be making his third collegiate start and has burst onto the scene to be South Carolina’s best starting pitcher based on a small sample size. He’s 2-0 with a 2.81 ERA. The Gamecocks have a very capable closer in Brett Kerry, who has a stat line of 3-1, 2.06 ERA and four saves.  After that, the bullpen is a mess with a bevy of arms with ERA’s ranging from 4.75 to 8.90. We’re talking about pitchers with 25-30 innings pitched with these high ERA’s. That indicates that South Carolina has very few quality options in the bullpen other than their closer.",https://texags.com/s/32058/series-preview-no-7-texas-am-vs-south-carolina

"Kyle Hendricks managed to take advantage of a cold wind blowing in at 26 mph on Friday afternoon, while a routine pop-up to short center field by Kris Bryant somehow became a two-run double to right in a 5-1 win over the Diamondbacks.

“Extraordinarily different wind conditions,” manager Joe Maddon said. “That makes Candlestick (Park) look tame. That was unbelievable.”

The winds of change have been blowing for the Cubs (9-9), who climbed back to .500 for the first time since they were 1-1 by winning their fourth straight game and their sixth of seven.

Hendricks (1-3) cruised for seven innings, keeping the conga line of solid starting pitching rolling. He allowed three hits and two walks while striking out 11 to follow gems by Jose Quintana and Cole Hamels. Their three straight starts of seven or more scoreless innings was the Cubs’ first such streak since Bill Hands, Milt Pappas and Juan Pizarro did it from Aug. 3-5, 1971.

The staff’s 31-inning scoreless streak, its longest since 1976, ended in the ninth inning, when Brad Brach allowed a run before Pedro Strop retired the final two hitters with runners on second and third for his second save. In seven games since a left hamstring injury sidelined Jon Lester , the starters have compiled an 0.96 ERA. Lester’s absence seems to have sparked the rest of the rotation to step up.

“We all expected that, them taking responsibility for themselves, for this team especially,” catcher Willson Contreras said. “I think that got into their minds — our biggest guy, Lester, went out, and we had to take his spot. Even when he comes back I hope they keep the same mentality out there.”

Hendricks came in with a 5.40 ERA, which obviously isn’t close to the pitcher he’s been in his first five seasons. Maddon said before the game he wasn’t concerned; afterward he called it “classic Kyle.”

Hendricks said the brilliance of Quintana and Hamels “has been filtering down to the rest of us guys.” On Friday he established his fastball early to set up hitters for his changeup.

“If we just keep attacking and put them on their heels, we know what our lineup can do,” Hendricks said.

With the flags flapping and the Diamondbacks fielders flopping, the entertainment began early whenever a ball was hit into the air.

Bryant’s two-out pop to center in the second blew several feet to the right, dropping in short right field as the exasperated Diamondbacks ran around like they were waiting for a Frisbee to come down.

It was a huge turn of events, as it appeared that Diamondbacks starter Merrill Kelly had escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam after Hendricks bunted into a fielder’s choice at home and Daniel Descalso struck out.

“Everyone knows the wind is blowing, but that one caught you by surprise because it drifted that far,” Maddon said.

Anthony Rizzo added a run-scoring triple in the fourth, and the Cubs added two more in the sixth to pull away.

The wind always has been a recurring theme on the North Side, whether it’s blowing in or out, whether it’s helping or hurting the Cubs. Managers have been crediting and cursing the wind for decades, with no end in sight.

“Our kind of weather — wind was blowing in,” manager Don Zimmer beamed after Mike Bielecki dominated on a similarly windy April day in 1990.

But when a would-be home run by Mike Fontenot turned into a game-ending out in a loss in August of 2007, manager Lou Piniella cried: “Where’s that Wrigley Field wind? Where’s it at? I thought it was out of the ballpark.”

Friday was more of the same.

Hendricks said he can’t focus on whether it’s blowing in or out, though he knew it might be a good day for him when he saw the direction the flags were flying when he walked into Wrigley.

“One hundred percent,” he said. “But on the flip side, when the wind is blowing out, usually your stuff is moving more, so there are positives to any aspect of it. But seeing the wind today, yeah, especially on righties, throwing a little more inside. But my focus is just on making a good pitch every time.”

Those unpredictable winds are one of the reasons Wrigley is a special place to watch a game.

But during games like Friday’s 3-hour, 24-minute affair, it was probably better to watch from a comfy couch or a premium club than riding it out.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-spt-cubs-diamondbacks-20190419-story.html
"Nothing came easy for the Angels in an 11-10 loss.

The game began at 7 p.m. The Angels fell behind 5-0, then 10-2, then their bats awoke right around the two-and-a-half-hour mark.

After the Angels tied the score at 10 in the bottom of the eighth inning on a David Fletcher home run, the Mariners used a single and a walk to put runners on first and second base against Cody Allen (0-1) in the top of the ninth.

With one fielder on the left side of the infield, Jay Bruce shot a ground ball through the shift and into left field, giving the Mariners the game-winning run. A scoreless ninth inning closed the door on a 3-hour, 59-minute whirlwind. The stunning sequence of events left a man to wonder what just happened.

“You always have a good feeling when you come back from a deficit and you tie the game and you’re at home and you feel like you have a really good chance to win it,” Angels manager Brad Ausmus said. “As much as you feel like that, it doesn’t always happen.”

The Angels (8-11) have lost four in a row, and their bullpen has allowed 14 runs in the four losses.

Allen, facing the music, accepted the blame for this one.


“Every guy in our lineup tonight had to do the same travel and they threw us on their back tonight, tried to pull us out of a deep hole. I didn’t do my job.”

Even the final outs were tense. Jon Lucroy led off the bottom of the ninth against Roenis Elias with a routine grounder to third base, where Ryon Healy slid to his left to smother the ball. Healy rose to one foot, hesitated, and threw late to first base – generously ruled a single. But after pinch-hitter Zack Cozart struck out and Peter Bourjos flew out, Elias got Fletcher – the would-be hero – to ground out to end the game.

Andrelton Simmons and Tommy La Stella each finished with three hits. Albert Pujols, Kole Calhoun and Bourjos each had two of the Angels’ season-high 16 hits.

Pujols drove in two runs. His 1,991 career RBIs moved him one behind Babe Ruth for fifth place on the all-time list.

Facing a 10-2 deficit, 11 Angels batted in the seventh inning. Seven scored. When Bourjos hit a ground ball for the third out, the announced crowd of 33,592 at Angel Stadium finally exhaled. The half-inning lasted a half-hour, transforming a 10-2 laugher into a 10-9 nailbiter.

In the top of the eighth, Seattle loaded the bases against Angels right-hander Luis Garcia on three consecutive walks. Garcia escaped his own predicament by getting Healy to chase a slider and pop out weakly to right-center field, too shallow to score a run. Dee Gordon grounded a ball up the middle, but Andrelton Simmons dove to stop the ball and fed second baseman La Stella for the inning-ending forceout. The Angels clung to their one-run deficit.",https://www.ocregister.com/2019/04/18/angels-rally-from-8-run-deficit-only-to-lose-to-mariners-11-10/

Both Leathernecks came up with big performances during their sweep of Oral Roberts in Macomb, which marked the first in ORU's history (1999-2012; 2015-present) as a Summit League member that they suffered a sweep in league play. 

Galassi finished the series 9-for-15, going 3-for-5 with a home run in each of the three contests. He also drove in a team-high seven runs, scored five runs and stole three bases. Galassi drove in three runs in both games one and three of the series and stole a pair of bases in the finale.

Drake retired the first 10 Golden Eagles he faced in Saturday's 7-3 win over ORU. He held the ORU bats scoreless and to just three hits through his first seven innings as Galassi and company staked him to a 7-0 lead. Drake added seven punchouts to bring his league-leading total to 61. It marked the sixth time this season he had seven or more strikeouts in a start.

"The Bentley University Falcons scored seven times in the bottom of the ninth but their comeback fell just short as Franklin Pierce University held on for a 10-9 win in Northeast-10 Conference Northeast Division  baseball Friday afternoon at DeFelice Field.

With Bentley down 10-2, the bottom of the ninth began with 16 straight balls thrown by the Ravens. An RBI single by junior center fielder Max Troiani (Pittsford, N.Y./Pittsford Mendon HS) made it 10-4 and the second bases-loaded walk of the inning, this one to junior third baseman Jake Pierce (East Bridgewater/East Bridgewater HS), reduced the deficit to five.

Singles by junior DH Ryan Berardino (Sudbury/Lincoln-Sudbury Reg. HS) and senior first baseman Brandon Grover (Rocky Hill, Conn./Rocky Hill HS) each brought in a run and a two-run single by senior right fielder Gino Fordiani (Sudbury/Lincoln-Sudbury Reg. HS) made it a one-run game.

However, the comeback ended when Franklin Pierce freshman righty Danny Gracia (Wilmington) got his third strikeout of the inning, stranding the potential tying run on third and the potential winning run on second.

With the bottom three in the Raven order scoring eight of Franklin Pierce's first nine runs, the visitors opened a 9-0 lead. The big blow was a two-out, bases-loaded triple by senior left fielder Brad Roberto (San Diego, Calif.) in the second.

" Despite the game being cut short by an inning, the Eagles (17-14) finished on top with a 15-3 victory over the Bates College Bobcats (11-12) in a single eight-inning non-conference game on a thunder and lightning-stricken evening on the road. 

After trailing 3-0 at the end of the second inning due to a few unfortunate Husson errors in the field paired with a Bobcat single by Kyle Carter and double down the left field line by leadoff batter Christian Beal, the Husson defense finally found their groove to put an end to the run scoring. The Eagles swapped roles and began pouring in a steady influx of runs throughout the next four innings as they started slow with one run in the third as a sacrifice fly from Luke Covey helped score Kobe Rogerson. 

The fourth inning was when Husson really raked in the runs, sending eight batters home on three hits and three stolen bases to bring the score to 8-3. Ethan Daigneault snuck home as Nick Guerrette distracted the fielders stealing second to put another runner in scoring position before the Bobcats put an end to the inning. 

After tacking on another six runs in the next two innings, Bates held Husson scoreless with two runners stranded over the next two innings before the game was called one inning short due to lightning and weather to leave Husson with a 15-3 victory in eight innings. 

ON THE MOUND:

Husson threw Alex Brooks to start as he picked up his third win of the season with one strikeout and not giving up any earned runs. Jesse Colford and Jacob Gauvin helped close the game by adding on two more K's and holding the Bobcats scoreless. 

For Bates, Ian Tolis opened pitching two scoreless innings and Henri Pratt closed two scoreless innings as four other Bobcats pitched in the middle. Overall the six Bates' pitchers combined for two punch outs and gave up eight walks with just ten earned runs. 

HUSSON OFF THE BAT:

Guerrette went a consistent 3-4 at the plate with two RBI and two runs scored.
Launching a triple, Conor Maguire smacked the biggest hit of the day as he went 2-5 with an RBI and run scored. 
Alex Chapman was nothing, but patient at the plate, walking three times to get on base and scoring two runs. 
BATES OFF THE BAT:

Beal, Carter, Jack Arend, and Dan Trulli tallied hits for the Bobcats on their home field.
Beal also helped out with two RBI and a double.
Bryan Gotti added on the Bobcats' third RBI of the day. 
UP NEXT!

Husson's doubleheader scheduled at New England College on Saturday, April 20th has been cancelled. Next up for the Eagles is a senior day NAC doubleheader on Wednesday, April 24th with games starting at 5:00 p.m. against Thomas College.

"The Ursinus College baseball team put on an incredible display of power hitting in an overwhelming 22-9 rout of Muhlenberg at Thomas Field.

The junior duo of Alex Mumme and Dom Fiorentino led the 22-run, 19-hit onslaught as they both crushed a pair of home runs to give the Bears a sweep of the Mules. It's believed to be the first time in school history that a pair of Ursinus sluggers left the yard twice in a game. Ursinus also posted its most runs in a Centennial Conference game since a 24-1 victory over Swarthmore in 2001.

Mumme's two blasts (a solo shot and grand slam) set the single-season and career records at Ursinus. He ended the day with ten homers for the season, moving his career total to 22. Mumme eclipsed 1981 graduate Craig Walck's 21-homer benchmark with a grand slam in the bottom of the fifth, part of an eight-run explosion that turned a tight game into a runaway. Mumme went 3-for-4 with five runs and five runs batted in.

Mumme and Fiorentino powered back-to-back blasts over the fence in the second to get things square at 4-4. Fiorentino finished with four hits, four runs, and four RBI atop the Bears' potent lineup.

Ursinus (16-13, 6-6) jumped out to an early 2-0 edge but the Mules eventually took an 8-4 lead in the fourth before a pair of huge innings by the Bears. The madness all started in the bottom of the fourth when the Bears plated six runs while sending 11 batters to the dish. After two runs in the sixth, the Bears scored 16 unanswered runs from the fourth to sixth before the Mules (16-14, 6-6) answered again in the seventh.

In the fourth, Fiorentino hit his second round-tripper of the game to the furthest part of the park in center. Freshman Jon Moldoff singled in Mumme, who reached on a walk. Moldoff drove in four runs.

The Bears worked three straight walks off the new Muhlenberg reliever to score a run. Junior Eric Gross then dropped in a two-run single to center to go up 9-8. Gross had a three-hit, three-RBI game. Junior Mike Stanziale then plopped a hit in front of the left fielder.

In the fifth, Ursinus posted an eight-spot in the line score. The Bears summoned a dozen hitters to the plate. Moldoff drove a sacrifice fly to left. Sophomore Jerry Scavone scorched an RBI liner past the third baseman. Gross collected a run batted in with a single to left, and Fiorentino walked with the bases loaded before Mumme cleared them with a grand slam to left field.",http://www.ursinusathletics.com/sports/bsb/2018-19/releases/20190418tmz182

"SPRINGFIELD, Mass. --  Sophomore Tucker Hetherman’s (Webster, Mass.) RBI single in the top of the sixth plated the go-ahead run to lead UMass Dartmouth to a 6-3 non-league college baseball victory over Western New England Thursday afternoon at Trelease Park.

The visiting Corsairs (12-15) started things off with a bang in their opening at-bat, as juniors JR DiSarcina (Barnstable, Mass.) and Mike Knell (Dennis, Mass.) belted solo homers to give UMass Dartmouth the early advantage.  DiSarcina extended that edge to 3-0 in the third when he scored on a wild pitch, but the host Golden Bears (18-10) evened matters with a three-run uprising in the bottom of the fifth on an error and a sacrifice fly off the bat of senior Brian Valeriano (Stratford, Conn.).

Knell led off the sixth by drawing a walk and stealing second before scoring the go-ahead on a single through the right side by Hetherman, who extended the Corsairs’ edge by stealing second and scoring on senior Jack Harrington’s (Barnstable, Mass.) RBI single down the right field line.  Hetherman closed out the scoring in the top of the ninth by driving in his second run of the contest on a fielder’s choice, and junior Nate Tellier (Attleboro, Mass.) worked around a ninth inning walk and struck out four of the seven batters he faced over the final two innings to pick up his fourth save of the spring.
